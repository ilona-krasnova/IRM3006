This article presents in the first part a study on the for gene, encoding a cGMP‐dependent protein kinase (PKG) in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. Cloning of the open reading frame allowed phylogenetic tracing, which showed conservation of PKGs among social insects. Our results confirm the proposed role for PKGs in division of labor. Btfor gene expression is significantly higher in the larger foragers compared with the smaller sized nurses. More importantly, we discovered an age‐related decrease in Btfor expression in both nursing and foraging bumblebees. We therefore speculate that the presence of BtFOR is required for correct adaptation to new external stimuli and rapid learning for foraging. In a second series of experiments, worker bumblebees of B. terrestris were treated with two insecticides imidacloprid and kinoprene, which have shown to cause impaired foraging behavior. Compared with controls, only the latter treatment resulted in a decreased Btfor expression, which concurs with a stimulation of ovarian growth and a shift in labor toward nest‐related tasks. The data are discussed in relation to Btfor expression in the complex physiological event of foraging and side‐effects by pesticides.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1520-6327\", \"PMID: 21136525\", \"ISSN: 1520-6327\", \"DOI: 10.1002/arch.20401\", \"ISSN: 0739-4462\"]}\n",

To study fundamental evolutionary questions at the genomic level, a high resolution genetic linkage map is an essential tool for analyses ranging from quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to genome assembly and comparative genomics. We here present a saturated linkage map and match it with the Apis mellifera genome using homologous markers. This genome-wide comparison allows insights into structural conservations and rearrangements and thus the evolution on a chromosomal level.\\nThe high density linkage map covers ~ 93% of the B. terrestris genome on 18 linkage groups (LGs) and has a length of 2'047 cM with an average marker distance of 4.02 cM. Based on a genome size of ~ 430 Mb, the recombination rate estimate is 4.76 cM/Mb. Sequence homologies of 242 homologous markers allowed to match 15 B. terrestris with A. mellifera LGs, five of them as composites. Comparing marker orders between both genomes we detect over 14% of the genome to be organized in synteny and 21% in rearranged blocks on the same homologous LG.\\nThis study demonstrates that, despite the very high recombination rates of both A. mellifera and B. terrestris and a long divergence time of about 100 million years, the genomes' genetic architecture is highly conserved. This reflects a slow genome evolution in these bees. We show that data on genome organization and conserved molecular markers can be used as a powerful tool for comparative genomics and evolutionary studies, opening up new avenues of research in the Apidae.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1471-2164\", \"EISSN: 1471-2164\", \"PMID: 21247459\", \"DOI: 10.1186/1471-2164-12-48\"]}\n",

The potential lethal effects together with the ecologically relevant sublethal effects on aspects of bumblebee reproduction and foraging behaviour were evaluated. Bumblebee workers were exposed via direct contact with wet and dry residues under laboratory conditions to spinetoram at different concentrations, starting from the maximum field recommended concentration (MFRC) and then different dilutions (1/10, 1/100, 1/1000 and 1/10 000 of the MFRC), and compared with spinosad. In addition, the side effects via oral exposure in supplemented sugar water were assessed.\\nRESULTS: Direct contact of B. terrestris workers with wet residues of spinosad and spinetoram showed spinetoram to be approximately 52 times less toxic than spinosad, while exposure to dry residues of spinetoram was about 8 times less toxic than exposure to those of spinosad. Oral treatment for 72 h (acute) indicated that spinetoram is about 4 times less toxic to B. terrestris workers compared with spinosad, while exposure for a longer period (i.e. 11 weeks) showed spinetoram to be 24 times less toxic. In addition, oral exposure to the two spinosyns resulted in detrimental sublethal effects on bumblebee reproduction. The no observed effect concentration (NOEC) for spinosad was 1/1000 of the MFRC, and 1/100 of the MFRC for spinetoram. Comparison between the chronic exposure bioassays assessing the sublethal effects on nest reproduction, with and without allowing for foraging behaviour, showed that the respective NOEC values for spinosad and spinetoram were similar over the two bioassays, indicating that there were no adverse effects by either spinosyn on the foraging of B. terrestris workers.\\nCONCLUSION: Overall, the present results indicate that the use of spinetoram is safer for bumblebees by direct contact and oral exposure than the use of spinosad, and therefore it can be applied safely in combination with B. terrestris. Another important conclusion is that the present data provide strong evidence that neither spinosyn has a negative effect on the foraging behaviour of these beneficial insects. However, before drawing final conclusions, spinetoram and spinosad should also be evaluated in more realistic field‐related situations for the assessment of potentially deleterious effects on foraging behaviour with the use of queenright colonies of B. terrestris.

Because body size has frequently been related to reproductive success in female insects, I examined the effect of B. terrestris queen size during hibernation, nest founding, and reproduction stages. Queens exhibited clear variation in size. Foundresses were significantly larger than gynes, indicating that larger queens may have an advantage over smaller ones in surviving hibernation. The over-representation of queens with pollen at larger sizes suggested that larger queens may also have an advantage over smaller ones in nest founding. On the other hand, foundress size was not significantly associated with reproductive output. The number of collected foundresses in this study was not sufficient to draw a clear conclusion but factors other than foundress size may also play an important role in determining reproduction. In addition, gyne size increased significantly during the 4-year survey. Because large queens have an advantage during hibernation, increased body size may increase the number of hibernating queens that survive, allowing them to outcompete native bumblebees.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1570-7458\", \"DOI: 10.1111/j.1570-7458.2010.01075.x\", \"ISSN: 0013-8703\", \"CODEN: ETEAAT\"]}\n",

Both bee species are commercial pollinators and many males are produced during their rearing. Gauze sleeves were used to isolate the inflorescences and to keep the males inside (one per sleeve).

The sleeves were also used to prevent other bees from reaching the flowers, and to allow self-pollination. Non-isolated flowers were pollinated by free-range bees. The effect of male bee pollination was similar to that of free-range bee pollination. The percentages of flowers that developed into fruit were as follows: male bufftailed bumblebee pollination, 79.5%; free-range bee pollination, 71.1%; male red mason bee pollination, 65.1%; and self-pollination, 46.4%; while the mean numbers of fruit per raceme were 5.0, 4.4, 3.6, and 2.4, respectively.

This alternative control strategy is referred to as pollinator‐and‐vector technology. The present study was designed to investigate the capacity of B. terrestris to fulfil this role in greenhouse strawberry flowers, which were manually inoculated with a major plant pathogen, the grey mould Botrytis cinerea Pers.: Fr. A model microbiological control agent (MCA) product Prestop‐Mix was loaded in a newly developed two‐way bumblebee dispenser, and, in addition, the use of the diluent Maizena‐Plus (corn starch) was tested.\\nRESULTS: Importantly, loading of the MCA caused no adverse effects on bumblebee workers, with no loss of survival or impairment of flight activity of the workers during the 4 week flowering period. Secondly, vectoring of Prestop‐Mix by bumblebees resulted in a higher crop production, as 71% of the flowers developed into healthy red strawberries at picking (preharvest yield) as compared with 54% in the controls. In addition, these strawberries were better protected, as 79% of the picked berries remained free of B. cinerea after a 2 day incubation (post‐harvest yield), while this percentage was only 43% in the control. Overall, the total yield (preharvest × post‐harvest) was 2–2.5 times higher than the total yield in the controls (24%) in plants exposed to bumblebees vectoring Prestop‐Mix. Thirdly, the addition of the diluent Maizena‐Plus to Prestop‐Mix at 1:1 (w/w) resulted in a similar yield to that of Prestop‐Mix used alone, and in no negative effects on the bumblebees, flowers and berries.\\nCONCLUSIONS: This greenhouse study provides strong evidence that B. terrestris bumblebees can vector a MCA to reduce B. cinerea incidence in greenhouse strawberries, resulting in higher yields. Similar yields obtained in the treatments with Prestop‐Mix and Prestop‐Mix + Maizena‐Plus suggest an equally efficient dissemination of the biocontrol agent into the flowers with only half the initial concentration of Prestop‐Mix, which illustrates the importance of the diluent.

Due to this life history trait, bumblebees are more susceptible to parasites and diseases than polyandrous and/or polygynous social insects. A greater resistance towards parasites is shown when the genetic variability within a colony is increased. The parasite resistance may be divided into different levels regarding the step of the parasite infection (e.g. parasite uptake, parasite intake, parasite's establishment in the nest, parasite transmission). We investigate the prophylactic behaviour of bumblebees. Bumblebees were observed during their foraging flights on two artificial flowers; one of these was contaminated by Crithidia bombi, a naturally occurring gut parasite of bumblebees (in a control experiment the non-specific pathogen Escherichia coli was used). For C. bombi, bumblebees were preferentially observed feeding on the non-contaminated flower. Whereas for E. coli, the number of visits between flowers was the same, bumblebees spent more time feeding on the non-contaminated flower. These results demonstrate the ability of bumblebees to recognise the contamination of food sources. In addition, bumblebees have a stronger preference for the non-contaminated flower when C. bombi is present in the other flower than with E. coli which might be explained as an adaptive behaviour of bumblebees towards this specific gut parasite. It seems that the more specific the parasite is, the more it reduces the reward of the flower.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 22039462\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0026328\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

Polyphenism has been key to the evolution of the Hymenoptera, and particularly the social Hymenoptera where the genome of a single species regulates distinct larval stages, sexual dimorphism and physical castes within the female sex. Transcriptomic analyses of social Hymenoptera will therefore provide unique insights into how changes in gene expression underlie such complexity. Here we describe gene expression in individual specimens of the pre-adult stages, sexes and castes of the key pollinator, the buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris.\\ncDNA was prepared from mRNA from five life cycle stages (one larva, one pupa, one male, one gyne and two workers) and a total of 1,610,742 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were generated using Roche 454 technology, substantially increasing the sequence data available for this important species. Overlapping ESTs were assembled into 36,354 B. terrestris putative transcripts, and functionally annotated. A preliminary assessment of differences in gene expression across non-replicated specimens from the pre-adult stages, castes and sexes was performed using R-STAT analysis. Individual samples from the life cycle stages of the bumblebee differed in the expression of a wide array of genes, including genes involved in amino acid storage, metabolism, immunity and olfaction.\\nDetailed analyses of immune and olfaction gene expression across phenotypes demonstrated how transcriptomic analyses can inform our understanding of processes central to the biology of B. terrestris and the social Hymenoptera in general. For example, examination of immunity-related genes identified high conservation of important immunity pathway components across individual specimens from the life cycle stages while olfactory-related genes exhibited differential expression with a wider repertoire of gene expression within adults, especially sexuals, in comparison to immature stages. As there is an absence of replication across the samples, the results of this study are preliminary but provide a number of candidate genes which may be related to distinct phenotypic stage expression.

To study fundamental evolutionary questions at the genomic level, a high resolution genetic linkage map is an essential tool for analyses ranging from quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to genome assembly and comparative genomics. We here present a saturated linkage map and match it with the Apis mellifera genome using homologous markers. This genome-wide comparison allows insights into structural conservations and rearrangements and thus the evolution on a chromosomal level. The high density linkage map covers ~ 93% of the B. terrestris genome on 18 linkage groups (LGs) and has a length of 2'047 cM with an average marker distance of 4.02 cM. Based on a genome size of ~ 430 Mb, the recombination rate estimate is 4.76 cM/Mb. Sequence homologies of 242 homologous markers allowed to match 15 B. terrestris with A. mellifera LGs, five of them as composites. Comparing marker orders between both genomes we detect over 14% of the genome to be organized in synteny and 21% in rearranged blocks on the same homologous LG. This study demonstrates that, despite the very high recombination rates of both A. mellifera and B. terrestris and a long divergence time of about 100 million years, the genomes' genetic architecture is highly conserved. This reflects a slow genome evolution in these bees. We show that data on genome organization and conserved molecular markers can be used as a powerful tool for comparative genomics and evolutionary studies, opening up new avenues of research in the Apidae.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1471-2164\", \"EISSN: 1471-2164\", \"DOI: 10.1186/1471-2164-12-48\"]}\n",

The changes in chemical composition of their CLG secretions with age are quite well known. In this study, we investigate the evolution of CLG secretions with age in greater detail and compare behavioural reactions of conspecific virgin queens to the secretions. We show that compounds of CLG secretions follow two profiles. Most of the compounds increase from the first day after emergence until the bees are 15-days-old and then decrease. Others are less abundant in 1 to 15-day-old males and then increase (e.g. tricosane, tricosene, henicosane, tetradecanoic acid, pentacosene, pentacosane, heptacosene, heptacosane, nonacosene and geranylcitronellyl tetradecanoate). Differences in secretion composition lead to preferences of virgin queens for males according to the male's age. Virgin queens prefer the pheromonal gland secretions of bees of the following ages in decreasing order; 1 day = 3 days < 7 days = 30 days < 15 days < 10 days. The virgin queens are strongly attracted by secretions containing high amounts of 2,3-dihydrofarnesol, 2,3-dihydrofarnesal, ethyl dodecanoate and hexadecanol.

Therefore, we investigated in this project the risks for effects, bioaccumulation and potential mechanisms of activity of PFOS in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) that is an important worldwide pollinator in the terrestrial compartment of wildflowers and cultivated crops. The exposure to PFOS occurred orally via the drinking of treated sugar water in a wide range from 1 μg/l up to 10 mg/l, containing environmentally relevant as well as high concentrations, and this was done with use of microcolonies of B. terrestris in the laboratory. A chronic toxicity assay demonstrated high bumblebee worker mortality (up to 100%) with an LC₅₀ of 1.01 mg/l (R ² = 0.98). In addition, PFOS posed strong detrimental reproductive effects, and these concerted with a dramatic reduction in ovarian size. HPLC-MS demonstrated a bioaccumulation factor of 27.9 for PFOS in bumblebee workers fed with sugar water containing 100 μg/l PFOS during 5 weeks (2184 ± 365 ng/g BW). Finally, potential mechanisms of activity were investigated to explain the significant impact of PFOS on survival and reproduction capacity of B. terrestris. Exposure of bumblebee workers to PFOS resulted in a significant decrease in mitochondrial electron transport activity (p = 0.035) and lipid amounts (p = 0.019), while the respective p-values were 0.58 and 0.12 for protein and glucose amounts. Hence, addition of PFOS to ecdysteroid responsive Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells resulted in a strong antagonistic action on the EcR-b.act.luc reporter construct, demonstrating that PFOS may exert its effects partially through an endocrine disrupting action via the insect molting hormone or ecdysteroid receptor.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s10646-011-0596-2\", \"EISSN: 1573-3017\", \"PMID: 21253836\", \"ISSN: 0963-9292\", \"CODEN: ECOTEL\"]}\n",

Bumblebee individuals used large areas (0.25-43.53 ha) within one or a few days. Habitat analyses of one B. hortorum queen at the landscape scale indicated that gardens within villages were used more often than expected from habitat availability. Detailed movement trajectories of this individual revealed that prominent landscape structures (e.g. trees) and flower patches were repeatedly visited. However, we also observed long (i.e. >45 min) resting periods between flights (B. hortorum) and differences in flower-handling between bumblebees with and without transmitters (B. terrestris) suggesting that the current weight of transmitters (200 mg) may still impose significant energetic costs on the insects.\\nSpatio-temporal movements of bumblebees can now be tracked with telemetry methods. Our measured flight distances exceed many previous estimates of bumblebee foraging ranges and suggest that travelling long distances to food resources may be common. However, even the smallest currently available transmitters still appear to compromise flower handling performance and cause an increase in resting behavior of bees. Future reductions of transmitter mass and size could open up new avenues for quantifying landscape-scale space use of insect pollinators and could provide novel insights into the behavior and requirements of bumblebees during critical life stages, e.g. when searching for mates, nest locations or hibernation sites.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 21603569\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0019997\"]}\n",

After introducing a single highly rewarding flower to the array, they re‐adjusted their routes visiting the most rewarding flower first provided the departure distance from the shortest possible route remained small (18%). When routes optimizing the initial rate of reward intake were much longer (42%), bees prioritized short travel distances.4. Under natural conditions, in which individual flowers vary in nectar productivity and replenish continuously, it might pay bees to prioritize highly rewarding locations, both to minimize the overall number of flowers to visit and to beat competitors.5. We discuss how combined memories of location and quality of resource patches could allow bees and other traplining animals to optimize their routing decisions in heterogeneous environments.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1365-2435\", \"CODEN: FECOE5\", \"ISSN: 0269-8463\", \"EISSN: 1365-2435\", \"PMID: 22267886\", \"DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01881.x\"]}\n",

Naturally relevant variation in the quality of the food environment formed a three-way interaction with both host and parasite identity in determining the outcome of infection, with regard to the resistance of the host and the transmission of the parasite. The demonstration of such a host-genotype by parasite-genotype by environment interaction (G H x G P x E) shows the importance of considering environmental variation when investigating host-parasite interactions.

We quantified the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by the flowers using gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry/flame-ionization-detection.

We used microsatellite markers to compare modern populations of B. terrestris, B. hortorum and B. ruderatus in the United Kingdom and New Zealand and to compare museum specimens of British B. subterraneus with the current New Zealand population. We used approximate Bayesian computation to estimate demographic parameters of the introduction history, notably to estimate the number of founders involved in the initial introduction. Species‐specific patterns derived from genetic analysis were consistent with the predictions based on the presumed history of these populations; demographic events have left a marked genetic signature on all four species.

Attaining reproductive skew requires energy investment in aggression or fertility signaling, creating a trade-off between reproduction and dominance. This may be density-dependent because the cost of achieving dominance may be higher in larger groups. We investigated the effect of group-size in B. terrestris queenless workers on two major reproduction-dominance correlates: between-worker aggression, and pheromone production, aiming at mimicking decision-making during the transition of worker behavior from cooperation and sterility to aggressive reproductive competition in whole colonies. Despite the competition, reproductive division of labor in colonies can be maintained even during this phase through the production of a sterility signal by sterile workers that has an appeasement effect on dominant nestmates. Worker-worker aggression, ovary activation, and production of sterility-appeasement signals may therefore constitute components of a trade-off affecting worker reproduction decisions. By constructing queenless groups of different size and measuring how this affected the parameters above, we found that in all groups aggression was not evenly distributed with the α-worker performing most of the aggressive acts. Moreover, aggression by the α-worker increased proportionally with group-size. However, while in small groups the α-worker monopolized reproduction, in larger groups several workers shared reproduction, creating two worker groups: reproductives and helpers. It appears that despite the increase of aggression, this was evidently not sufficient for the α-worker to monopolize reproduction. If we compare the α-worker to the queen in full-sized colonies it can be hypothesized that worker reproduction in B. terrestris colonies starts due to a gradual increase in the worker population and the queen's inability to physically inhibit worker oviposition. This may shift the trade-off between cost and benefit of worker reproduction and trigger the competition phase.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 21464893\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0018238\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

There is a lack of immune genes in social insects (e.g. honeybees) when compared to Diptera. Potentially, this might be compensated by an advanced system of social immunity (synergistic action of several individuals). The bumble bee, Bombus terrestris, is a primitively eusocial species with an annual life cycle and colonies headed by a single queen. We used this key pollinator to study the temporal dynamics of immune system gene expression in response to wounding and bacterial challenge.Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) (abaecin, defensin 1, hymenoptaecin) were strongly up-regulated by wounding and bacterial challenge, the latter showing a higher impact on the gene expression level. Sterile wounding down-regulated TEP A, an effector gene of the JAK/STAT pathway, and bacterial infection influenced genes of the Imd (relish) and JNK pathway (basket). Relish was up-regulated within the first hour after bacterial challenge, but decreased strongly afterwards. AMP expression following wounding and bacterial challenge correlates with the expression pattern of relish whereas correlated expression with dorsal was absent. Although expression of AMPs was high, continuous bacterial growth was observed throughout the experiment.Here we demonstrate for the first time the temporal dynamics of immune system gene expression in a social insect. Wounding and bacterial challenge affected the innate immune system significantly. Induction of AMP expression due to wounding might comprise a pre-adaptation to accompanying bacterial infections. Compared with solitary species this social insect exhibits reduced immune system efficiency, as bacterial growth could not be inhibited. A negative feedback loop regulating the Imd-pathway is suggested. AMPs, the end product of the Imd-pathway, inhibited the up-regulation of the transcription factor relish, which is necessary for effector gene expression.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 21479237\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0018126\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

In insects, for example, broadband photoreceptors, with a major sensitivity peak in the green region of the spectrum (>500 nm), drive fast visual processes, which are largely blind to chromatic signals from more narrowly-tuned photoreceptors with peak sensitivities in the blue and UV regions of the spectrum. In addition, electrophysiological properties of the photoreceptor membrane may result in differences in response dynamics of photoreceptors of similar spectral class between species, and different spectral classes within a species. We used intracellular electrophysiological techniques to investigate response dynamics of the three spectral classes of photoreceptor underlying trichromatic colour vision in the bumblebee, Bombus impatiens, and we compare these with previously published data from a related species, Bombus terrestris. In both species, we found significantly faster responses in green, compared with blue- or UV-sensitive photoreceptors, although all 3 photoreceptor types are slower in B. impatiens than in B. terrestris. Integration times for light-adapted B. impatiens photoreceptors (estimated from impulse response half-width) were 11.3 ± 1.6 ms for green photoreceptors compared with 18.6 ± 4.4 ms and 15.6 ± 4.4 for blue and UV, respectively. We also measured photoreceptor input resistance in dark- and light-adapted conditions. All photoreceptors showed a decrease in input resistance during light adaptation, but this decrease was considerably larger (declining to about 22% of the dark value) in green photoreceptors, compared to blue and UV (41% and 49%, respectively). Our results suggest that the conductances associated with light adaptation are largest in green photoreceptors, contributing to their greater temporal processing speed.

Few studies have investigated whether foragers perceive conspecifics as informers or competitors.

Bumble-bees foraged on either ‘simple’ (two colours) or ‘complex’ (four colours) artificial floral communities. We found that conspecifics at low density may be used as sources of information in first flower choices, whereas they appeared as competitors over the whole foraging sequence. Low conspecific densities improved foragers' first-visit success rate in the simple environment, and decreased time to first landing, especially in the complex environment. High conspecific densities did not affect these behavioural parameters, but reduced flower constancy in both floral communities, which may alter the efficiency of pollinating visits. These results suggest that the balance of the costs and benefits of conspecific presence varies with foraging experience, floral community and density.

We monitored locomotor activity of Bombus terrestris queens at various life cycle stages, and queens for which we manipulated the presence of brood or removed the ovaries. We found that gynes typically emerged from the pupae with no circadian rhythms, but after several days showed robust rhythms that were not affected by mating or diapauses. Colony-founding queens with brood showed attenuated circadian rhythms, irrespective of the presence of ovaries. By contrast, queens that lost their brood switched again to activity with strong circadian rhythms. The discovery that circadian rhythms in bumble-bee queens are regulated by the life cycle and the presence of brood suggests that plasticity in the circadian clock of bees is ancient and related to maternal behaviour or physiology, and is not a derived trait that evolved with the evolution of the worker caste.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 21508036\", \"ISSN: 1471-2954\", \"EISSN: 1471-2945\", \"ISSN: 0962-8452\", \"EISSN: 1471-2954\", \"DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2011.0579\"]}\n",

To identify what constitutes an abnormal pathophysiological condition in a honey bee colony, it is critical to have characterized the spectrum of exogenous infectious agents in healthy hives over time. We conducted a prospective study of a large scale migratory bee keeping operation using high-frequency sampling paired with comprehensive molecular detection methods, including a custom microarray, qPCR, and ultra deep sequencing. We established seasonal incidence and abundance of known viruses, Nosema sp., Crithidia mellificae, and bacteria. Ultra deep sequence analysis further identified four novel RNA viruses, two of which were the most abundant observed components of the honey bee microbiome (∼10(11) viruses per honey bee). Our results demonstrate episodic viral incidence and distinct pathogen patterns between summer and winter time-points.

In nature, they are genetically highly diverse. ► We here show experimentally that different strains of C. bombi undergo genetic exchange when co-infecting a natural host. ► Offspring strains of such exchanges are either recombinants that correspond to Mendelian expectations, strains that have lost alleles, or strains that have novel genotypes. ► The experiment shows that genetic exchange in C. bombi is frequent.\\nThe breeding structure of protozoan infections, i.e. whether and how frequently parasites exchange genes (“sexual reproduction”), is a crucially important parameter for many important questions; it also matters for how new virulent strains might emerge. Whether protozoan parasites are clonal or sexual is therefore a hotly debated issue. For trypanosomatids, few experimental tests of breeding structure exist to date and are limited to the vector-borne human diseases Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania major. We infected the natural host (Bombus terrestris) of the monoxenous parasite Crithidia bombi (Trypanosomatida) either with a single strain of the parasite or in mixed infections and tested for genetic exchange among co-infecting strains using microsatellite markers. We show that strains regularly exchange genetic material, with occasional self-crossing during mixed infections. Most offspring clones fit the expected allelic pattern from a standard Mendelian segregation. In some cases, alleles are lost or gained, leading to an entirely new genotype different from either parent. Genetic exchange in C. bombi therefore does occur and the process also leads to allelic loss or gain that could result from slippage during recombination. The majority of novel offspring types correspond to a recombination of parental alleles. The case of C. bombi demonstrates that directly transmitted, monoxenic trypanosomatids can also exchange genes. Sex therefore seems to be found in very different lineages of the trypanosomatids.

Molecular diversity indices show overall high mtDNA diversity for the populations, but low nucleotide divergence between haplotypes. Our results indicate relatively little geographic population structure among the southern populations, especially given the extensive distributional range and an expectation of limited gene flow between populations. We implemented neutrality tests to assess signatures of recent historical demographic events. Tajima's D test and Fu's F(S) test both suggested recent population growth for the populations. The results were only significant for the southernmost populations when applying Tajima's D, but Fu's F(S) indicated significant deviations from neutrality for all populations except the one closest to the equator. Based on our own findings and those from pollen and vegetation studies, we hypothesize that the species range of B. anynana was reduced to equatorial refugia during the last glacial period, and that the species expanded southwards during the past 10.000 years.

To do this, day-active insects rely primarily on the pattern of apparent motion generated on the retina during flight (optic flow). However, many flying insects are active at night, when obtaining reliable visual information for flight control presents much more of a challenge. To assess whether nocturnal flying insects also rely on optic flow cues to control flight in dim light, we recorded flights of the nocturnal neotropical sweat bee, Megalopta genalis, flying along an experimental tunnel when: (i) the visual texture on each wall generated strong horizontal (front-to-back) optic flow cues, (ii) the texture on only one wall generated these cues, and (iii) horizontal optic flow cues were removed from both walls. We find that Megalopta increase their groundspeed when horizontal motion cues in the tunnel are reduced (conditions (ii) and (iii)). However, differences in the amount of horizontal optic flow on each wall of the tunnel (condition (ii)) do not affect the centred position of the bee within the flight tunnel. To better understand the behavioural response of Megalopta, we repeated the experiments on day-active bumble-bees (Bombus terrestris). Overall, our findings demonstrate that despite the limitations imposed by dim light, Megalopta—like their day-active relatives—rely heavily on vision to control flight, but that they use visual cues in a different manner from diurnal insects.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1744-957X\", \"DOI: 10.1098/rsbl.2010.1205\", \"PMID: 21307047\", \"ISSN: 1744-9561\", \"EISSN: 1744-957X\"]}\n",

The global trade in commercial bumble bee (Bombus spp.) colonies provides pollination services for both glasshouse and open-field crops. For example, in the United Kingdom, commercial colonies of nonnative subspecies of the bumble bee Bombus terrestris L. imported from mainland Europe are widely used for the pollination of raspberries, Rubus idaeus L. The extent to which these commercial colonies supplement the services provided by wild pollinators has not been formally quantified and the impact of commercial bumble bees on native bees visiting the crop is unknown. Here, the impacts of allowing commercially available bumble bee colonies to forage on raspberry canes are assessed in terms of the yield of marketable fruit produced and the pollinator communities found foraging on raspberry flowers. No differences were found in the abundance, diversity, or composition of social bee species observed visiting raspberry flowers when commercial bumble bees were deployed compared with when they were absent. However, weight of marketable raspberries produced increased when commercial bees were present, indicating that wild pollinator services alone are inadequate for attaining maximum yields. The findings of the study suggests that proportional yield increases associated with deployment of commercial colonies may be small, but that nevertheless, investment in commercial colonies for raspberry pollination could produce very significant increases in net profit for the grower. Given potential environmental risks associated with the importation of nonnative bumble bees, the development of alternative solutions to the pollination deficit in raspberry crops in the United Kingdom may be beneficial.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1938-291X\", \"CODEN: JEENAI\", \"ISSN: 0022-0493\", \"PMID: 21404847\", \"EISSN: 0022-0493\", \"EISSN: 1938-291X\", \"DOI: 10.1603/EC10092\"]}\n",

This is because the process of science is little different from the deeply resonant, natural processes of play. Play enables humans (and other mammals) to discover (and create) relationships and patterns. When one adds rules to play, a game is created. This is science: the process of playing with rules that enables one to reveal previously unseen patterns of relationships that extend our collective understanding of nature and human nature. When thought of in this way, science education becomes a more enlightened and intuitive process of asking questions and devising games to address those questions. But, because the outcome of all game-playing is unpredictable, supporting this ‘messyness’, which is the engine of science, is critical to good science education (and indeed creative education generally). Indeed, we have learned that doing ‘real’ science in public spaces can stimulate tremendous interest in children and adults in understanding the processes by which we make sense of the world. The present study (on the vision of bumble-bees) goes even further, since it was not only performed outside my laboratory (in a Norman church in the southwest of England), but the ‘games’ were themselves devised in collaboration with 25 8- to 10-year-old children. They asked the questions, hypothesized the answers, designed the games (in other words, the experiments) to test these hypotheses and analysed the data. They also drew the figures (in coloured pencil) and wrote the paper. Their headteacher (Dave Strudwick) and I devised the educational programme (we call ‘i,scientist’), and I trained the bees and transcribed the childrens' words into text (which was done with smaller groups of children at the school's local village pub). So what follows is a novel study (scientifically and conceptually) in ‘kids speak’ without references to past literature, which is a challenge. Although the historical context of any study is of course important, including references in this instance would be disingenuous for two reasons. First, given the way scientific data are naturally reported, the relevant information is simply inaccessible to the literate ability of 8- to 10-year-old children, and second, the true motivation for any scientific study (at least one of integrity) is one's own curiousity, which for the children was not inspired by the scientific literature, but their own observations of the world. This lack of historical, scientific context does not diminish the resulting data, scientific methodology or merit of the discovery for the scientific and ‘non-scientific’ audience. On the contrary, it reveals science in its truest (most naive) form, and in this way makes explicit the commonality between science, art and indeed all creative activities. Principal finding ‘We discovered that bumble-bees can use a combination of colour and spatial relationships in deciding which colour of flower to forage from. We also discovered that science is cool and fun because you get to do stuff that no one has ever done before.

Venom serine proteases from bumblebees did not cross-react with antibodies against the honeybee venom serine protease.

Here, we report the first successful use of micro radio telemetry to track flight distances and space use of bumblebees. Using ground surveys and Cessna overflights in a Central European rural landscape mosaic we obtained maximum flight distances of 2.5 km, 1.9 km and 1.3 km for Bombus terrestris (workers), Bombus ruderatus (worker), and Bombus hortorum (young queens), respectively. Bumblebee individuals used large areas (0.25-43.53 ha) within one or a few days. Habitat analyses of one B. hortorum queen at the landscape scale indicated that gardens within villages were used more often than expected from habitat availability. Detailed movement trajectories of this individual revealed that prominent landscape structures (e.g. trees) and flower patches were repeatedly visited. However, we also observed long (i.e. >45 min) resting periods between flights (B. hortorum) and differences in flower-handling between bumblebees with and without transmitters (B. terrestris) suggesting that the current weight of transmitters (200 mg) may still impose significant energetic costs on the insects. Spatio-temporal movements of bumblebees can now be tracked with telemetry methods. Our measured flight distances exceed many previous estimates of bumblebee foraging ranges and suggest that travelling long distances to food resources may be common. However, even the smallest currently available transmitters still appear to compromise flower handling performance and cause an increase in resting behavior of bees. Future reductions of transmitter mass and size could open up new avenues for quantifying landscape-scale space use of insect pollinators and could provide novel insights into the behavior and requirements of bumblebees during critical life stages, e.g. when searching for mates, nest locations or hibernation sites.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0019997\"]}\n",

However, little is known about the effects of such ancillary signals when they are auditory rather than olfactory. The few studies that have investigated this question have provided conflicting results. The current study sought to clarify and extend understanding of the effects of prey auditory signals on avian predator responses. The domestic chick Gallus gallus domesticus was used as a model avian predator to examine how the defensive buzzing sound of a bumblebee Bombus terrestris affected the chick’s innate avoidance behavior, and the learning and memory of prey avoidance. The results demonstrate that the buzzing sound had no effect on the predator’s responses to unpalatable aposematically colored crumbs, suggesting that the agitated buzzing of B. terrestris may provide no additional protection from avian predators.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 2058-5888\", \"ISSN: 1674-5507\", \"ISSN: 2396-9814\", \"EISSN: 2396-9814\", \"DOI: 10.1093/czoolo/57.2.197\", \"ISSN: 2058-5888\"]}\n",

Numerous mechanisms could be behind this decline, and the spread of parasites from commercial colonies into wild populations has been implicated recently in North America. Commercial breeding may lead to declines because commercial colonies may have high parasite loads, which can lead to colonization of native bumble bee populations; commercial rearing may allow higher parasite virulence to evolve; and global movement of commercial colonies may disrupt spatial patterns in local adaptation between hosts and parasites. We assessed parasite virulence, transmission mode, and infectivity. Microparasites and so-called honey bee viruses may pose the greatest threat to native bumble bee populations because certain risk factors are present; for example, the probability of horizontal transmission of the trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi is high. The microsporidian parasite Nosema bombi may play a role in declines of bumble bees in the United States. Preliminary indications that C. bombi and the neogregarine Apicystis bombi may not be native in parts of South America. We suggest that the development of molecular screening protocols, thorough sanitation efforts, and cooperation among nongovernmental organizations, governments, and commercial breeders might immediately mitigate these threats. Los abejorros son un grupo de polinizadores que son importantes tanto ecológica como económicamente y están declinando en todo el mundo. Hay numerosos mecanismos que pudieran estar detrás de esta declinación, y en Norte América recientemente se ha involucrado a la extensión de parásitos de colonias comerciales hacia poblaciones silvestres. La crianza comercial puede causar declinaciones porque las colonias comerciales pueden tener cargas altas de parásitos, lo que puede llevar a la colonización de poblaciones de abejorros nativos; la crianza comercial puede permitir que evolucione una mayor virulencia de parásitos; y el movimiento global de colonias comerciales puede alterar patrones espaciales en la adaptación local entre huéspedes y parásitos. Evaluamos la virulencia de parásitos, el modo de transmisión y la infectividad. Los microparásitos y los llamados virus de abejas pueden ser la mayor amenaza para las poblaciones de abejorros nativos debido a la presencia de ciertos factores de riesgo; por ejemplo, la probabilidad de transmisión horizontal del tripanosoma parásito Crithidia bombi es alta. El microesporido parásito Nosema bombi puede jugar un papel en las declinaciones de abejorros en los Estados Unidos.

By comparing bumblebees in agricultural landscapes of different complexity in Southern Sweden, we here demonstrate that also the adult size of bumblebee foragers is significantly related to the availability of foraging resources. This effect was independent of both species identity and foraging habitat type. This suggests a shortage of flower resources in landscapes of lower complexity, which may also affect the reproductive success of colonies negatively.\\nEs wird angenommen, dass der negative Einfluss der landwirtschaftlichen Intensivierung auf Hummelpopulationen teilweise durch einen Verlust an Nahrungspflanzen hervorgerufen wird, beispielsweise wegen höherer Feldgrößen und dem damit verbundenen Verlust an Feldrändern und ihren Nektar- und Pollenpflanzen.

Specifically, we asked whether one component of the floral display, scent, improved a bee's certainty about the value of another component, color hue. We first trained two groups of bumble bees (Bombus impatiens Cresson) to discriminate between rewarding and unrewarding artificial flowers of slightly different hues in the presence vs absence of scent. In a test phase, we presented these bees with a gradient of floral hues and assessed their ability to identify the hue rewarded during training. We interpreted the extent to which bees' preferences were biased away from the unrewarding hue ('peak shift') as an indicator of uncertainty in color discrimination. Our data show that the presence of an olfactory signal reduces uncertainty regarding color: not only was color learning facilitated on scented flowers but also bees showed a lower amount of peak shift in the presence of scent. We explore potential mechanisms by which scent might reduce uncertainty about color, and discuss the broader significance of our results for our understanding of signal evolution.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\", \"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.047407\", \"PMID: 21147975\"]}\n",

A few colonies with a poor filtering ability thus contributed disproportionately to the parasite population in the next season. High strain diversity but not high infection intensity within colony was associated with an increased probability of transmission of the infection to new queens. Interestingly, the representation of the different strains changed dramatically over time, so that long-term parasite success could not be predicted from short-term observations.

In forests of NW Patagonia, the only native bumble bee and major pollinator, Bombus dahlbomii, declined almost to extinction as the alien B. ruderatus increased in abundance since its first appearance about 17 years ago. To explore whether resource competition might have driven this displacement we studied the behavior and foraging efficiency of both bumble bees while they harvested nectar from flowers of Alstroemeria aurea, the main summer food resource in the forests of NW Patagonia. We compared the nectar content of flowers that bees selected, recently visited, and rejected with that of randomly-chosen neighboring flowers and assessed differences in visitation rates. The native bumble bee selects flowers with abundant nectar and mostly exploits nectar-rich flower patches by rejecting a higher proportion of flowers with little or no nectar. On the other hand, the alien bumble bee discriminated less with respect to sugar content per visited flower, but visited more flowers per minute. Workers of the native bumble bee harvested ~70% more sugar per unit of time than those of the alien species in absolute terms, and a similar amount when sugar harvested was expressed as a percentage of body mass. In contrast to expectation, the opportunistic foraging of the alien bumblebee was not more efficient and therefore cannot explain the ecological extinction of the native species through exploitative competition. These findings suggest that the displacement of the native species by the alien may be driven by other factors, such as the associated introduction of novel diseases or parasites.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1387-3547\", \"EISSN: 1573-1464\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s10530-011-9972-3\"]}\n",

Although wing wear in insects is often used as a method to determine insect age, and is associated with an increased risk of mortality, the causes of wing wear are unresolved. In this paper, we examine whether wing use while foraging explains wing wear in bumble bees (Bombus spp.). Wing wear may result from three distinct flight characteristics during foraging: time spent in flight, flight frequency and frequency of wing collisions with vegetation. To test these hypotheses for causes of wing wear, we recorded digital video of individually marked bumble bees foraging in nature on 12 different plant species that result in variation in these flight characteristics, and recaptured these individuals to photograph their wings over time. Bumble bees with a higher frequency of wing collisions showed an increased loss of wing area, which became more severe over time. Neither time in flight nor flight frequency was uniquely and significantly associated with wing wear. Therefore, the collision frequency hypothesis best explained wing wear in bumble bees. We conclude that wing use during foraging in bumble bees results in wing wear. Wing wear reflects behaviour, not simply age. Because wing wear has elsewhere been shown to increase mortality, this study provides an important mechanism linking foraging behaviour with lifespan.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.051730\", \"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"PMID: 21562177\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\"]}\n",

Overall, these studies suggest that queen-worker pheromone communication is a multi-component, labile dialog between the castes, rather than a simple, fixed signal-response system. We also discuss future approaches that can shed light on the proximate and ultimate mechanisms that underlie these complex systems by focusing on the development of increasingly sophisticated genomic tools and their potential applications to examine the molecular mechanisms that regulate pheromone production and perception.\", \"identifier\": [\"CODEN: JCECD8\", \"PMID: 22083225\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s10886-011-0036-z\", \"EISSN: 1573-1561\", \"ISSN: 0098-0331\"]}\n",

We observed individually identifiable bumble bees foraging in 1-m super(2) patches of high and low floral density of 3 plant types (Geranium viscosissimum, Melilotus alba/officinalis, and Monarda fistulosa). Bee preference for flower density was determined by an interaction between wing area and bee body size: small worn-winged bees selected patches of higher density, whereas large worn-winged bees selected patches of lower density. Bees with more worn wings spent less time in flight and flew less often; however, only foragers collecting pollen appeared to reduce wing-use behavior (i.e., wing collision frequency) that leads to loss of wing area. This study demonstrates that individuals respond to wing damage in different ways depending on their body size and foraging task.

Here we show that both white and red hummingbird-pollinated flowers differ from bee-pollinated flowers in their reflection properties for ultraviolet (UV) light. Hummingbird-pollinated red flowers are on average less UV reflective, and white hummingbird-pollinated flowers are more UV reflective than the same coloured bee-pollinated ones. In preference tests with artificial flowers, neotropical orchid bees prefer red UV-reflecting artificial flowers and white UV-nonreflecting flowers over red and white flowers with the opposite UV properties. By contrast, hummingbirds showed no preference for any colour in the same tests.

However, little is known about monarch butterflies' color perception or learning ability, despite the importance of visual information to butterfly behavior in the contexts of nectar foraging, host-plant location and mate recognition. We used both theoretical and experimental approaches to address basic questions about monarch color vision and learning ability. Color space modeling based on the three known spectral classes of photoreceptors present in the eye suggests that monarchs should not be able to discriminate between long wavelength colors without making use of a dark orange lateral filtering pigment distributed heterogeneously in the eye. In the context of nectar foraging, monarchs show strong innate preferences, rapidly learn to associate colors with sugar rewards and learn non-innately preferred colors as quickly and proficiently as they do innately preferred colors. Butterflies also demonstrate asymmetric confusion between specific pairs of colors, which is likely a function of stimulus brightness. Monarchs readily learn to associate a second color with reward, and in general, learning parameters do not vary with temporal sequence of training. In addition, monarchs have true color vision; that is, they can discriminate colors on the basis of wavelength, independent of intensity. Finally, behavioral trials confirm that monarchs do make use of lateral filtering pigments to enhance long-wavelength discrimination. Our results demonstrate that monarchs are proficient and flexible color learners; these capabilities should allow them to respond rapidly to changing nectar availabilities as they travel over migratory routes, across both space and time.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\", \"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.048728\", \"PMID: 21228210\"]}\n",

In both visual systems, motion vision measured with the optomotor response is color blind and mediated by one photoreceptor type only. Here, we ask whether this is also the case if the moving stimulus is restricted to a small part of the visual field, and test what influence velocity may have on chromatic motion perception. Honeybees were trained to discriminate between clockwise- and counterclockwise-rotating sector disks. Six types of disk stimuli differing in green receptor contrast were tested using three different rotational velocities. When green receptor contrast was at a minimum, bees were able to discriminate rotation directions with all colored disks at slow velocities of 6 and 12 Hz contrast frequency but not with a relatively high velocity of 24 Hz. In the goldfish experiment, the animals were trained to detect a moving red or blue disk presented in a green surround. Discrimination ability between this stimulus and a homogenous green background was poor when the M-cone type was not or only slightly modulated considering high stimulus velocity (7 cm/s). However, discrimination was improved with slower stimulus velocities (4 and 2 cm/s). These behavioral results indicate that there is potentially an object motion system in both honeybee and goldfish, which is able to incorporate color information at relatively low velocities but is color blind with higher speed. We thus propose that both honeybees and goldfish have multiple subsystems of object motion, which include achromatic as well as chromatic processing.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 21518470\", \"EISSN: 1469-8714\", \"DOI: 10.1017/S0952523811000101\", \"ISSN: 0952-5238\"]}\n",

Single‐colour models comprised the colours sky blue, bright green, yellow, red, white and black.

When different hues of blue (of different shapes) are compared, sky blue is preferred over turquoise, followed by dark blue, indicating that H. apicicornis is more attracted to lighter hues of blue than to darker ones. No significant differences are found between the three shapes (circle, square and triangle) tested, suggesting that reflectance associated with colour could be a more important visual cue than shape for host location by H. apicicornis.

We evaluated if variation in the body size and weight of workers of stingless bees fluctuates across a seasonal pattern and if this could be related to characteristics of the food consumed during the larval stage. The weight of larval provisions, their protein, and sugar content were evaluated in four colonies of Nannotrigona perilampoides every 2 months across 1 year. Worker-destined larvae from the same combs were allowed to develop and were sampled as callow workers to determine their weight and size using morphometric data. The weight and size of workers were highly correlated and varied across the seasons in established colonies, suggesting that size variation cycles across the year in stingless bees. An increase in the protein content and, to a lesser degree, the quantity of larval food were positively linked to variation in body weight and size; food with richer protein content resulted in larger and heavier workers. This study provides the first evidence of an effect of the quantity and composition of larval food on the size of workers in stingless bees. Although body weight and size of workers differed across seasons, they were not readily noticeable as changes seem to occur as a continuum across the year. Since size polymorphism was of a larger magnitude across time but not within age cohorts and as it was highly determined by food resources, it may not be an adaptive feature in stingless bees. However, more studies are needed to determine the role of the cyclical change in worker body size on colony performance and thus its adaptive significance in stingless bees.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1420-9098\", \"ISSN: 0020-1812\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s00040-010-0113-2\"]}\n",

Optimum bee stocking rates have, however, yet to be established. To determine stocking rates, five pollination trials were conducted. For each trial, 50 plants of Capsicum annuum L. var. grossum (L.) Sendt cv. Aries were placed in each of two glasshouses and a colony of T. carbonaria randomly assigned to one of the two glasshouses. The other glasshouse contained no bees and acted as a control. The grade and weight of fresh fruit increased by 26% and 24%, respectively, for plants subjected to bee pollination. To determine the number of pollination events required for optimum pollination, during the final trial, 110 flowers were randomly selected and covered with organza draw-string bags. The bags were removed between 10.00 and 11.00 h on the day of assessment to allow between one to ten pollination events to occur. A pollination event was deemed to have occurred each time a bee touched the stigma. There were no significant increases in pollen grain numbers on stigmatic surfaces after three pollination events. It was therefore determined that for optimum pollination to occur, T. carbonaria needed to come into contact with C. annuum stigmatic surfaces three times. The stocking rate was calculated from number of pollen foragers per hour, the mean number of foraging hours per day, the mean number of flowers that bees visited per hour, the number of flowers per plant in anthesis at any given time and the number of pollination events required to reach optimum pollination. The mean light intensity, temperature and relative humidity for all observations were 17869 Lx, 23°C and 47%, respectively and, under these conditions, one T. carbonaria OATH hive per ~1900 C. annuum plants was optimal.

For the first time, B. terrestris nest structures, and their contents such as larvae, pupae and eggs, were non-invaseively viewed and assessed. This technique will enable future experiments to take morphological measurements of egg, larval, and pupal development over time. Moreover, combining these measurements with measures of food-storage will provide a good assessment of colony health.

The defence of social insects might occur at different levels, the individual and the group. Individual defence occurs in part via the innate immune system resulting in the expression of antimi-crobial substances. Group level defences, summarised as 'social immunity', represent a suite of behavioural and organisational features. Here, all effects contributing to social immunity except for the social context were removed from bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) workers, kept either in groups or solitarily. The gene expression of six effector molecules of the immune system was monitored in both groups and in controls from the same source colonies. The social treatment has a highly significant effect on immune gene expression, with groups exhibiting higher levels of two antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and two lysozymes. Phenoloxidase is affected at the regulatory level, with a strong upregulation of its suppressor Spn27A in groups suggesting a trade-off with antimicrobial activity. AMPs are strongly upregulated in groups, whereas lysozymes are strongly downregulated in solitary treatments suggesting another trade-off.

In bumblebees, colonies adopt either a short-lived strategy specializing in male production, or a longer-lived strategy in which mainly new queens are produced, but this results in males emerging long before mates are available; this strategy can only easily be explained if older males are at a significant reproductive advantage. Here we examine how age and morphological characters influence mating success of male bumblebees. In two separate experiments in which single virgin males and females were confined together, we found that young males and heavy males mated more swiftly and copulated for less time compared to old males or lighter males, respectively. However, in competitive situations age proved to be unimportant and the only factors to influence mating success were the lengths of the fore and hind tibiae, with strong directional selection for long leg length. Fore and hind legs are both used in courtship, so both traits are associated with plausible mechanisms under selection. It has previously been argued that, in times of food stress, bumblebee colonies should produce males as male size is less likely to be strongly correlated with fitness than female size. Our results suggest that this may not be so, since aspects of male size directly impact on their mating success. Our results leave unexplained the emergence of males many days before new queens.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s10905-011-9306-4\", \"EISSN: 1572-8889\", \"CODEN: JIBEE8\", \"ISSN: 0892-7553\"]}\n",

One conspicuous threat to bumble bees is their unintended exposure to trace residues of systemic neonicotinoid pesticides, such as imidacloprid, which are ingested when bees forage on the nectar and pollen of treated crops. However, the demographic consequences for bumble bees of exposure to dietary neonicotinoids have yet to be fully established. To determine whether environmentally realistic levels of imidacloprid are capable of making a demographic impact on bumble bees, we exposed queenless microcolonies of worker bumble bees,\\nBombus terrestris\\n, to a range of dosages of dietary imidacloprid between zero and 125 μg L\\n−1\\nand examined the effects on ovary development and fecundity. Microcolonies showed a dose-dependent decline in fecundity, with environmentally realistic dosages in the range of 1 μg L\\n−1\\ncapable of reducing brood production by one third. In contrast, ovary development was unimpaired by dietary imidacloprid except at the highest dosage. Imidacloprid reduced feeding on both syrup and pollen but, after controlling statistically for dosage, microcolonies that consumed more syrup and pollen produced more brood. We therefore speculate that the detrimental effects of imidacloprid on fecundity emerge principally from nutrient limitation imposed by the failure of individuals to feed. Our findings raise concern about the impact of neonicotinoids on wild bumble bee populations. However, we recognize that to fully evaluate impacts on wild colonies it will be necessary to establish the effect of dietary neonicotinoids on the fecundity of bumble bee queens.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1573-3017\", \"PMID: 22614036\", \"ISSN: 0963-9292\", \"CODEN: ECOTEL\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s10646-012-0927-y\"]}\n",

In this study, we assessed the prevalence and species composition of mites associated with commercial bumblebee nests and determined if the mites are foreign species for Poland and for Europe. The study was conducted on 37 commercial bumblebee nests from two companies (Dutch and Israeli), originating from two greenhouses in southern Poland, and on 20 commercial bumblebee colonies obtained directly from suppliers. The species composition and abundance of mites inhabiting commercial bumblebee nests were determined. Seven mite species from three families were found in nests after greenhouse exploitation. The predominant mite species was Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Acaridae) that was a 100-fold more numerous than representatives of the family Laelapidae (Hypoaspis marginepilosa, H. hyatti, H. bombicolens). Representatives of Parasitidae (Parasitellus fucorum, P. crinitus, P. ignotus) were least numerous. All identified mite species are common throughout Europe, foreign species were not found.

One conspicuous threat to bumble bees is their unintended exposure to trace residues of systemic neonicotinoid pesticides, such as imidacloprid, which are ingested when bees forage on the nectar and pollen of treated crops. However, the demographic consequences for bumble bees of exposure to dietary neonicotinoids have yet to be fully established. To determine whether environmentally realistic levels of imidacloprid are capable of making a demographic impact on bumble bees, we exposed queenless microcolonies of worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, to a range of dosages of dietary imidacloprid between zero and 125 μg L(-1) and examined the effects on ovary development and fecundity. Microcolonies showed a dose-dependent decline in fecundity, with environmentally realistic dosages in the range of 1 μg L(-1) capable of reducing brood production by one third. In contrast, ovary development was unimpaired by dietary imidacloprid except at the highest dosage. Imidacloprid reduced feeding on both syrup and pollen but, after controlling statistically for dosage, microcolonies that consumed more syrup and pollen produced more brood. We therefore speculate that the detrimental effects of imidacloprid on fecundity emerge principally from nutrient limitation imposed by the failure of individuals to feed. Our findings raise concern about the impact of neonicotinoids on wild bumble bee populations. However, we recognize that to fully evaluate impacts on wild colonies it will be necessary to establish the effect of dietary neonicotinoids on the fecundity of bumble bee queens.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1573-3017\", \"EISSN: 1573-3017\", \"ISSN: 0963-9292\", \"CODEN: ECOTEL\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s10646-012-0974-4\"]}\n",

Subsequently the association between colour and reward was reversed, meaning bees then had to learn to visit blue flowers. We demonstrate that individuals that were fast to learn yellow as a predictor of reward were also quick to reverse this association. Furthermore, overnight memory retention tests suggest that faster learning individuals are also better at retaining previously learned information. There is also an effect of relatedness: colonies whose workers were fast to learn the association between yellow and reward also reversed this association rapidly. These results are inconsistent with a trade-off between learning speed and the reversal of a previously made association.

This raises the question of whether conspecific cues are inherently more influential than cues provided by heterospecifics, or whether animals can simply use any cue that predicts fitness enhancing conditions, including those provided by heterospecifics. To determine how freely social information travels across species boundaries, we trained bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) to learn to use cues provided by conspecifics and heterospecific honey bees (Apis mellifera) to locate valuable floral resources. We found that heterospecific demonstrators did not differ from conspecifics in the extent to which they guided observers' choices, whereas various types of inorganic visual cues were consistently less effective than conspecifics. This was also true in a transfer test where bees were confronted with a novel flower type. However, in the transfer test, conspecifics were slightly more effective than heterospecific demonstrators. We then repeated the experiment with entirely naïve bees that had never foraged alongside conspecifics before. In this case, heterospecific demonstrators were equally efficient as conspecifics both in the initial learning task and the transfer test. Our findings demonstrate that social learning is not a unique process limited to conspecifics and that through associative learning, interspecifically sourced information can be just as valuable as that provided by conspecific individuals.

Here, we report on the structure of leg tendon glands in males of Bombus terrestris, together with a description of the chemical composition of their secretions and respective changes of both during the males’ lives. The ultrastructure of leg tendon glands shows that the secretory cells are located in three independent regions, separated from each other by unmodified epidermal cells: in the femur, tibia, and basitarsus. Due to the common site of secretion release, the organ is considered a single secretory gland. The secretion of the leg tendon glands of B. terrestris males differs in its composition from those of workers and queens, in particular by (1) having larger proportions of compounds with longer chain lengths, which we identified as wax esters; and (2) by the lack of certain hydrocarbons (especially long chain dienes). Other differences consist in the distribution of double bond positions in the unsaturated hydrocarbons that are predominantly located at position 9 in males but distributed at seven to nine different positions in the female castes. Double bond positions may change chemical and physical properties of a molecule, which can be recognized by the insects and, thus, may serve to convey specific information. The function of male-specific compounds identified from their tendon glands remains elusive, but several possibilities are discussed.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00114-012-0986-1\", \"ISSN: 0028-1042\", \"EISSN: 1432-1904\", \"PMID: 23111660\"]}\n",

Such mechanisms have been proposed in bees, but have not yet been experimentally demonstrated. We provide evidence that selective attention influences the foraging performance of two social bee species, the honeybee Apis mellifera and the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. Visual search tasks, originally developed for application in human psychology, were adapted for behavioural experiments on bees. We examined the impact of distracting visual information on search performance, which we measured as error rate and decision time. We found that bumblebees were significantly less affected by distracting objects than honeybees. Based on the results, we conclude that the search mechanism in honeybees is serial like, whereas in bumblebees it shows the characteristics of a restricted parallel-like search. Furthermore, the bees differed in their strategy to solve the speed–accuracy trade-off. Whereas bumblebees displayed slow but correct decision-making, honeybees exhibited fast and inaccurate decision-making. We propose two neuronal mechanisms of visual information processing that account for the different responses between honeybees and bumblebees, and we correlate species-specific features of the search behaviour to differences in habitat and life history.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\", \"PMID: 22723491\", \"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.066399\"]}\n",

The occurrence of worker policing in \\\"primitively\\\" eusocial species with low mating frequencies, which lack relatedness differences conducive to policing, suggests that separate factors may underlie the origin and maintenance of worker policing. We tested this hypothesis by investigating conflict over male parentage in the primitively eusocial, monandrous bumblebee, Bombus terrestris. Using observations, experiments, and microsatellite genotyping, we found that: (a) worker- but not queen-laid male eggs are nearly all eaten (by queens, reproductive, and nonreproductive workers) soon after being laid, so accounting for low observed frequencies of larval and adult worker-produced males; (b) queen- and worker-laid male eggs have equal viabilities; (c) workers discriminate between queen- and worker-laid eggs using cues on eggs and egg cells that almost certainly originate from queens. The cooccurrence in B. terrestris of these three key elements of \\\"classical\\\" worker policing as found in the highly eusocial, polyandrous honeybees provides novel support for the hypothesis that worker policing can originate in the absence of relatedness differences maintaining it. Worker policing in B. terrestris almost certainly arose via reproductive competition among workers, that is, as \\\"selfish\\\" policing.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01709.x\", \"ISSN: 1558-5646\", \"PMID: 23206135\", \"ISSN: 0014-3820\", \"EISSN: 1558-5646\"]}\n",

The parasites laid transparent white and elongated eggs. Newly hatched larval size and shape were very similar to eggs but they were identified by their body segments. Larvae increased their body size through moulting and transformed into a vermiform shape. Male pupae were shiny brown with dots. The female pupae were distinguished by their black shiny color, shorter size and the presence of compound eyes. Adult male pupae were dark brown and dwarf-winged, whereas female pupae were macropterous and brachypterous. Reproduction took place by fertilization and also parthenogenetically.

However, it remains unclear whether geometric information is encoded by explicitly computing the layout of surface geometry or by matching images of the environment. View-based spatial encoding is generally thought to hold for insect navigation and, very recently, evidence for navigation by geometry has been reported in ants but only in a condition which does not allow the animals to use features located far from the goal. In this study we tested the spatial reorientation abilities of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). After spatial disorientation, by passive rotation both clockwise and anticlockwise, bumblebees had to find one of the four exit holes located in the corners of a rectangular enclosure. Bumblebees systematically confused geometrically equivalent exit corners (i.e. corners with the same geometric arrangement of metric properties and sense, for example a short wall to the left of a long wall). However, when one wall of the enclosure was a different colour, bumblebees appeared to combine this featural information (either near or far from the goal) with geometric information to find the correct exit corner.

We sought to explore how the bumblebee Bombus terrestris copes with tasks involving flower colour discrimination under patchy illumination. Light patches varied between unobscured daylight and leaf-shade, as a bee might encounter in and around woodland. Using a flight arena and coloured filters, as well as one or two different colours of artificial flower, we quantified how bees chose to forage when presented with foraging tasks under patchy illumination. Bees were better at discriminating a pair of similar colours under simulated unobscured daylight illumination than when foraging under leaf-shade illumination. Accordingly, we found that bees with prior experience of simulated daylight but not leaf-shade illumination initially preferred to forage in simulated daylight when all artificial flowers contained rewards as well as when only one colour was rewarding, whereas bees with prior experience of both illuminants did not exhibit this preference. Bees also switched between illuminants less than expected by chance. This means that bees prefer illumination conditions with which they are familiar, and in which rewarding flower colours are easily distinguishable from unrewarding ones. Under patchy illumination, colour discrimination performance was substantially poorer than in homogenous light. The bees' abilities at coping with patchy light may therefore impact on foraging behaviour in the wild, particularly in woodlands, where illumination can change over short spatial scales.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\", \"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.065565\", \"PMID: 22675177\"]}\n",

Seasonal fluctuations in prevalence and the occurrence of multiple infections of the gut parasite Crithidia bombi were analyzed in repeatedly sampled populations of two common bumblebee (Bombus spp.) species. Prevalence of C. bombi was greatest in the middle of the foraging season and coincided with the maximal occurrence of multiple infections. Both decline later in the season. The genetic structure of the parasite population also showed strong seasonal fluctuations with a drastic decline in effective population size and an increase in linkage disequilibrium when infection rates were highest. These effects are mainly attributable to significant changes in parasite allele frequencies leading to selection of specific alleles and increasing the frequency of homozygote genotypes in the middle of the season. Within host, competition between parasite genotypes might explain the observed pattern leading to selection of these alleles, and thus a boost of homozygote genotypes in the middle of the season. Toward the end of the season, selection appears to relax and we observed a recovery in linkage equilibrium, as well as an increase in effective population size. This might be explained by genetic exchange in these trypanosomes in natural populations.\\nThe manuscript presents the study of the prevalence and the intensity of infection of the gut parasite Crithidia bombi in temporally distinct samples of two common bumblebee species, Bombus terrestris and Bombus lapidarius and its effects on the population genetic structure of the parasite.

Furthermore, by chemical analyses, we have demonstrated that the parasite females adjust to the odor profiles of their host queens in order to maintain the level of fertility signaling inside the host colony although the host queen is absent.

These values were greater than those of laboratory-reared colonies in the native ranges of B. terrestris.

These alien workers were responsible for the heterogeneous genotype distribution within each B. terrestris colony, resulting in higher estimates of paternity frequency than of insemination frequency. The high mating frequency of introduced B. terrestris may have occurred by artificial selection through mass breeding for commercialization.

This study reports on the development of a laboratory miniature‐dispenser‐based bioassay. This bioassay system was used to investigate the compatibility of five model products, Prestop‐Mix, Signum, kaolin, wheat flour and cellulose, with the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris L.\\nRESULTS: The laboratory one‐way miniature‐dispenser bioassay showed that the fungicides and the carrier/diluent kaolin caused a worker mortality of > 70% after 5 weeks of exposure, while worker loss with wheat flour and cellulose was no higher than in the blank control (i.e. empty miniature dispenser) (<25%). The laboratory two‐way miniature‐dispenser bioassay comprised separated passageways and demonstrated that only kaolin was toxic (89 ± 11%). These results were also confirmed in a flight‐cage experiment. In addition, a negative effect was observed against reproduction/colony development when nests were exposed to kaolin (P < 0.05) in the two‐way miniature‐dispenser and flight‐cage bioassays.\\nCONCLUSIONS: In the context of entomovectoring technology, the developed laboratory two‐way miniature‐dispenser bioassay gives a reliable prediction of the hazards associated with powder products. Additionally, the present data indicate the possibility of using cellulose and kaolin as respective negative and positive control carriers/diluents in future risk assessment experiments. Overall, the results show that, apart from kaolin, the tested fungicides and carriers/diluents are safe to be used with B. terrestris.

We address this question using the interaction between bumblebees and the colour-changing crab spider Misumena vatia which can camouflage itself on some flowers. In laboratory experiments, we exposed bumblebees to an array of flowers concealing robotic predators (a trapping mechanism combined with a 3D life-sized model of a crab spider or a circle). Groups of bees were trained to avoid either cryptic yellow spiders or yellow circles (equal area to the spiders) or remained predator naive. The bees were then exposed to a new patch of white flowers containing some cryptic predators (either white spiders, white circles or a mixture of both). We monitored individual foraging choices and used a 3D video tracking system to quantify the bees' flight behaviour. The bees trained to avoid cryptic spiders, chose 40% fewer spider-harbouring flowers than expected by chance, but were indifferent to cryptic circles. They also aborted a higher proportion of landings on flowers harbouring spiders, ultimately feeding from half as many 'dangerous' flowers as naive bees. Previous encounters with cryptic spiders also influenced the flight behaviour of bees in the new flower patch. Experienced bees spent more time inspecting the flowers they chose to reject (both with and without concealed spiders) and scanned from side to side more in front of the flowers to facilitate predator detection. We conclude that bees disentangle shape from colour cues and thus can form a generalised search image for spider shapes, independent of colour.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00265-011-1295-y\", \"EISSN: 1432-0762\", \"ISSN: 0340-5443\"]}\n",

Population dynamics of the invasive weed Lupinus arboreus in Tasmania, and interactions with two non‐native pollinators. Weed Research52, 535–541. SUMMARY: The factors that determine which plant species become invasive weeds are not well understood and there have been few studies of population dynamics in the early stages of invasion. Here, we examine changes in population size, pollinator visitation and seed set of the tree lupin, Lupinus arboreus, in Tasmania between 1999 and 2010. Lupinus arboreus is a native of California that has become a major environmental weed in New Zealand and Chile, but has not yet become a serious weed in Tasmania. Our data suggest that the main pollinators of L. arboreus are honeybees and the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, which invaded in 1992. There was no clear evidence for an impact of the arrival of bumblebees. Lupinus arboreus population size increased by 76% between 1999 and 2010, despite weed control programmes. Populations appeared to be unstable; 43% of populations detected in 1999 were extinct by 2010, but this was more than offset by establishment of new populations. Inland populations tended to be smaller and were more likely to go extinct, compared with coastal populations, and some coastal populations had increased fourfold in 11 years. Large populations in 2010 tended to have higher seed set than smaller populations. The overall rate of increase suggests that L. arboreus may become a major environmental weed in Tasmania. Control of expanding populations is likely to become more difficult if, as we observed, seed set increases with population size.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-3180.2012.00935.x\", \"ISSN: 0043-1737\", \"EISSN: 1365-3180\", \"ISSN: 1365-3180\", \"CODEN: WEREAT\"]}\n",

We therefore studied the temporal and spatial structure of the male population of Bombus terrestris (Linnaeus 1758) and Bombus lapidarius (Linnaeus 1758) using microsatellite DNA markers. We found that the majority of the males in a 1000 m² sampling area originated from colonies located outside of the workers foraging range, which was consistent with the genetic distances among colonies. The analyses of temporal population sub‐structure based on both colony detection rate over time and the clustering software STRUCTURE consistently suggested one large and temporally unstructured male population. Our results indicate an extended male flight distance for both species. Though the range of queen dispersal remains to be studied, the effective size (Ne) of bumblebees is increased by extended male mating flight ranges (Am) exceeding worker foraging distance by factor 1.66 (Am = 69.75 km2) and 1.74 (Am = 13.41 km2), B. terrestris and B. lapidarius, respectively. Thus this behaviour may counteract genetic deprivation and its effects. All populations were genetically highly diverse and showed no signs of inbreeding.

In eusocial Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps), the discovery of worker reproductive parasitism recently challenged the view of workers as a homogeneous collective entity and stressed the need to consider them as autonomous units capable of elaborate choices which influence their fitness returns. The reproductive decisions of individual workers thus need to be investigated and taken into account to understand the regulation of reproduction in insect societies. However, we know virtually nothing about the proximate mechanisms at the basis of worker reproductive decisions. Here, we test the hypothesis that the capacity of workers to reproduce in foreign colonies lies in their ability to react differently according to the colonial context and whether this reaction is influenced by a particular internal state. Using the bumble bee Bombus terrestris, we show that workers exhibit an extremely high reproductive plasticity which is conditioned by the social context they experience. Fertile workers reintroduced into their mother colony reverted to sterility, as expected. On the contrary, a high level of ovary activity persisted in fertile workers introduced into a foreign nest, and this despite more frequent direct contacts with the queen and the brood than control workers. Foreign workers' reproductive decisions were not affected by the resident queen, their level of fertility being similar whether or not the queen was removed from the host colony. Workers' physiological state at the time of introduction is also of crucial importance, since infertile workers failed to develop a reproductive phenotype in a foreign nest. Therefore, both internal and environmental factors appear to condition individual reproductive strategies in this species, suggesting that more complex decision-making mechanisms are involved in the regulation of worker reproduction than previously thought.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0052217\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"PMID: 23251701\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

Bumblebees visited flowers of about 40 plant species. Comparisons of bumblebee assemblages among three locations during the later periods revealed apparent differences in species compositions. B. beaticola was the most common species at the Kurodake site, while B. hypocrita represented more than 90% of the individuals observed at the Hisago-Numa site. One worker of the introduced species B. terrestris was noted at the Hisago-Numa site although it seemed to be an accidental visit to the alpine area from a lowland colony.

A vast majority of deceptive syndromes occur within the orchid family.

One prime example of such a case is Cypripedium calceolus, known as European lady’s slipper orchid. While the flower has been of interest to many prominent scientists for over a century, its pollination is still not fully understood. Both visual and olfactory cues seem to play an important role in pollinator attraction. In this study we focussed on the olfactory cues in order to explore their relationship (in future experiments) with floral visual cues, including the unique asymmetry of these flowers. Some of the plants’ floral fragrances were used in Electroantennography experiments. Eleven chemical compounds were applied to the antennae of Bombus terrestris and Apis mellifera. Even though these species are not regular visitors of C. calceolus, we were interested to see whether there were common principles in their responses to the flowers’ scent that might justify extrapolating to other pollinator species such as sand bees that get trapped in these orchids and fly out of the flowers afterwards with pollen smeared on their body. The results show that while both species react similarly to most of the odours, some of the tested acetates induced a significantly greater reaction in B. terrestris antennae. These acetates play an important role in bumblebee pheromones, but their relevance for the natural pollinators of C. calceolus remains to be confirmed to see whether chemical mimicry by these flowers is deliberately employed to attract pollinators.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1875-9866\", \"EISSN: 1383-4517\", \"ISSN: 1383-4517\", \"DOI: 10.1163/18759866-08102005\"]}\n",

One potential threat to bees is the unintended impact of systemic insecticides, which are ingested by bees in the nectar and pollen from flowers of treated crops. To establish whether imidacloprid, a systemic neonicotinoid and insect neurotoxin, harms individual bees when ingested at environmentally realistic levels, we exposed adult worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), and honey bees, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), to dietary imidacloprid in feeder syrup at dosages between 0.08 and 125μgl−1. Honey bees showed no response to dietary imidacloprid on any variable that we measured (feeding, locomotion and longevity). In contrast, bumble bees progressively developed over time a dose-dependent reduction in feeding rate with declines of 10–30% in the environmentally relevant range of up to 10μgl−1, but neither their locomotory activity nor longevity varied with diet. To explain their differential sensitivity, we speculate that honey bees are better pre-adapted than bumble bees to feed on nectars containing synthetic alkaloids, such as imidacloprid, by virtue of their ancestral adaptation to tropical nectars in which natural alkaloids are prevalent. We emphasise that our study does not suggest that honey bee colonies are invulnerable to dietary imidacloprid under field conditions, but our findings do raise new concern about the impact of agricultural neonicotinoids on wild bumble bee populations.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 23044068\", \"ISSN: 1873-2720\", \"EISSN: 1873-2720\", \"ISSN: 0944-2006\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.zool.2012.05.003\"]}\n",

High genetic relatedness among co-infecting derived but not primary genotypes supported this scenario. Co-infection in queens seems to be a major driver for the diversity of genotypes circulating in host populations.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 23145099\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0049137\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

To date, the impact of plant population size on pollen collection by pollinators has not yet been investigated. From 2008 to 2010, we monitored nine bumble bee species (Bombus campestris, Bombus hortorum s.l., Bombus hypnorum, Bombus lapidarius, Bombus pascuorum, Bombus pratorum, Bombus soroensis, Bombus terrestris s.l., Bombus vestalis s.l.) on Vaccinium uliginosum (Ericaceae) in up to nine populations in Belgium ranging in size from 80 m(2) to over 3.1 ha. Bumble bee abundance declined with decreasing plant population size, and especially the proportion of individuals of large bumble bee species diminished in smaller populations. The most remarkable and novel observation was that bumble bees seemed to switch foraging behaviour according to population size: while they collected both pollen and nectar in large populations, they largely neglected pollen collection in small populations. This pattern was due to large bumble bee species, which seem thus to be more likely to suffer from pollen shortages in smaller habitat fragments. Comparing pollen loads of bumble bees we found that fidelity to V. uliginosum pollen did not depend on plant population size but rather on the extent shrub cover and/or openness of the site. Bumble bees collected pollen only from three plant species (V.uliginosum, Sorbus aucuparia and Cytisus scoparius). We also did not discover any pollination limitation of V. uliginosum in small populations. We conclude that habitat fragmentation might not immediately threaten the pollination of V. uliginosum, nevertheless, it provides important nectar and pollen resources for bumble bees and declining populations of this plant could have negative effects for its pollinators. The finding that large bumble bee species abandon pollen collection when plant populations become small is of interest when considering plant and bumble bee conservation.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0050353\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"PMID: 23209721\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

Probably, this explains that detection of small, distant, or moving objects is typically mediated through achromatic signals. Macroglossum stellatarum are fast flying nectarivorous hawkmoths that inspect flowers with their long proboscis while hovering. They can visually control this behaviour using floral markings known as nectar guides. Here, we investigate whether this is mediated by chromatic or achromatic cues. We evaluated proboscis placement, foraging efficiency, and inspection learning of naïve moths foraging on flower models with coloured markings that offered either chromatic, achromatic or both contrasts. Hummingbird hawkmoths could use either achromatic or chromatic signals to inspect models while hovering. We identified three, apparently independent, components controlling proboscis placement: After initial contact, 1) moths directed their probing towards the yellow colour irrespectively of luminance signals, suggesting a dominant role of chromatic signals; and 2) moths tended to probe mainly on the brighter areas of models that offered only achromatic signals. 3) During the establishment of the first contact, naïve moths showed a tendency to direct their proboscis towards the small floral marks independent of their colour or luminance. Moths learned to find nectar faster, but their foraging efficiency depended on the flower model they foraged on. Our results imply that M. stellatarum can perceive small patterns through colour vision. We discuss how the different informational contents of chromatic and luminance signals can be significant for the control of flower inspection, and visually guided behaviours in general.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 22529922\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0034629\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

Parasites are known to be an important factor in the some of the population declines of honey bees and bumblebees, but little is known about the parasites afflicting most other pollinators, or the extent of interspecific transmission or vectoring of parasites. Here we carry out a preliminary screening of pollinators (honey bees, five species of bumblebee, three species of wasp, four species of hoverfly and three genera of other bees) in the UK for parasites. We used molecular methods to screen for six honey bee viruses, Ascosphaera fungi, Microsporidia, and Wolbachia intracellular bacteria. We aimed simply to detect the presence of the parasites, encompassing vectoring as well as actual infections. Many pollinators of all types were positive for Ascosphaera fungi, while Microsporidia were rarer, being most frequently found in bumblebees. We also detected that most pollinators were positive for Wolbachia, most probably indicating infection with this intracellular symbiont, and raising the possibility that it may be an important factor in influencing host sex ratios or fitness in a diversity of pollinators. Importantly, we found that about a third of bumblebees (Bombus pascuorum and Bombus terrestris) and a third of wasps (Vespula vulgaris), as well as all honey bees, were positive for deformed wing virus, but that this virus was not present in other pollinators. Deformed wing virus therefore does not appear to be a general parasite of pollinators, but does interact significantly with at least three species of bumblebee and wasp. Further work is needed to establish the identity of some of the parasites, their spatiotemporal variation, and whether they are infecting the various pollinator species or being vectored. However, these results provide a first insight into the diversity, and potential exchange, of parasites in pollinator communities.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 22347356\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0030641\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

Conical cells in the petal epidermis are common across many diverse flowering plant species, and it was recently shown that in difficult-to-handle flowers, pollinators prefer conical cells because they increase grip. However, this does not explain the prevalence of conical cells amongst other, simpler, flowers. 2. The movement of objects is an integral part of the world and is of particular importance to bees because the relative motion of objects is essential to a bee's 3D vision. The motion of flowers can increase pollinator attraction; however, it also makes flowers more difficult for a bee to handle. This makes foraging more metabolically expensive. To explore whether conical petal cells make handling moving flowers easier, we tested bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) preference for conical- or flat-celled Petunia (Petunia hybrida) flowers under different conditions of motion. We also used differently coloured Petunia flowers to test how colour and visibility interact with tactile cues to form a pollinator's preferences. 3. Bees preferred to visit conical-celled Petunia flowers except when the conical-celled flowers were harder to detect visually. The bees then favoured flowers that were easier to detect. But when flowers were moving and more difficult to handle, bees always learned to favour conical-celled flowers, irrespective of visual difficulty. 4. By providing easier handling through better grip from conical cells, the plant can benefit from the natural visual attractant of flowers moving in the wind without losing pollinator preference for easier-to-handle flowers. Bee preference for conical-celled flowers when flowers are moving shows how plants can use conical petal cells to take advantage of an attractant that would otherwise decrease pollinator preference by making handling difficult (movement). The selective pressure from pollinators choosing conical-celled flowers when flowers are moving in the wind provides an explanation for the persistence of conical cells in so many diverse angiosperm species across evolutionary time.\", \"identifier\": [\"CODEN: FECOE5\", \"ISSN: 0269-8463\", \"EISSN: 1365-2435\", \"DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2435.2012.02009.x\"]}\n",

This report summarizes the results from Daisetsuzan National Park. We observed the species composition of bumblebees and their flower use pattern at the Akadake site from early June to late August. We recorded 473 bumblebees during 12 observation periods consisting of Bombus hypocrita sapporoensis (60%), B. hypnorum koropokkrus (18%), B. beaticola moshkarareppus (14%), B. yezoensis (7%), and B. diversus tersatus (1%). The introduced species, B. terrestris, was not observed. The frequency of bumblebees showed a bimodal pattern in mid-June (by overwintered queens) and after late July (by workers). Bumblebees visited flowers of about 40 plant species. Comparisons of bumblebee assemblages among three locations during the later periods revealed apparent differences in species compositions. B. beaticola was the most common species at the Kurodake site, while B. hypocrita represented more than 90% of the individuals observed at the Hisago-Numa site. One worker of the introduced species B. terrestris was noted at the Hisago-Numa site although it seemed to be an accidental visit to the alpine area from a lowland colony. Continuous monitoring of bumblebee assemblages in alpine sites is necessary to detect global warming impacts on species composition and the expansion of introduced organisms into alpine ecosystems.\\n環境省生物多様性センターのモニタリングサイト1000では、2011年より高山帯におけるマルハナバチ相のモニタリング調査を開始した。最初の登録地である北海道大雪山国立公園における初年度の調査概要を報告する。赤岳登録地の森林限界から高山帯において、6月上旬から8月下旬にかけて、計12回のライントランセクトによるマルハナバチ相、ならびに訪花植物の調査を行った。調査シーズンを通して、総計473個体が確認された。その内訳は、エゾオオマルハナバチが60%、アカマルハナバチが18%、エゾヒメマルハナバチが14%、エゾナガマルハナバチが7%、エゾトラマルハナバチが1%であり、移入種のセイヨウオオマルハナバチは確認されなかった。出現頻度は、6月中旬と7月下旬以降に高くなる二山分布を示し、前者は越冬明けの女王バチ、後者は働きバチが多数を占めていた。季節を通して約40種の植物への訪花が観察され、マルハナバチ類は高山帯において重要な花粉媒介者であることが確認された。マルハナバチ活動最盛期に黒岳登録地とヒサゴ沼調査地で同様の調査を行なったところ、マルハナバチ相は顕著な地域差が見られた。黒岳登録地ではエゾヒメマルハナバチの頻度が50%と最も高かった。ヒサゴ沼調査地ではエゾオオマルハナバチの頻度が90%以上を占めていた。また、ヒサゴ沼調査地ではセイヨウオオマルハナバチの侵入が初めて観察された。気候変動や移入種の侵入による今後のマルハナバチ相の動向について、継続調査の重要性が示された。\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1342-4327\", \"ISSN: 2424-1431\", \"DOI: 10.18960/hozen.17.2_263\", \"EISSN: 2424-1431\"]}\n",

Animal hosts harbour diverse and often specific bacterial communities (microbiota) in their gut. These microbiota can provide crucial services to the host such as aiding in digestion of food and immune defence. However, the ecological factors correlating with and eventually shaping these microbiota under natural conditions are poorly understood. 2. Bumblebees have recently been shown to possess simple and highly specific microbiota. We here examine the dynamics of these microbiota in field colonies of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris over one season. The gut bacteria were assessed with culture-independent methods, that is, with terminal restriction fragment length profiles of the 16S rRNA gene. 3. To further understand the factors that affect the microbiota, we experimentally manipulated field-placed colonies in a fully factorial experiment by providing additional food or by priming the workers' immune system by injecting heat-killed bacteria. We furthermore looked at possible correlates of diversity and composition of the microbiota for (i) natural infections with the microbial parasites Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi, (ii) bumblebee worker size, (iii) colony identity, and (iv) colony age. 4. We found an increase in diversity of the microbiota in individuals naturally infected with either C. bombi or N. bombi. Crithidia bombi infections, however, appear to be only indirectly linked with higher microbial diversity when comparing colonies. The treatments of priming the immune system with heat-killed bacteria and additional food supply, as well as host body size, had no effect on the diversity or composition of the microbiota. Host colony identity had only a weak effect on the composition of the microbiota at the level of resolution of our method. We found both significant increases and decreases in the relative abundance of selected bacterial taxa over the season. 5. We present the first study on the ecological dynamics of gut microbiota in bumblebees and identify parasite infections, colony identity and colony age as important factors influencing the diversity and composition of the bacterial communities. The absence of an effect of our otherwise effective experimental treatments suggests a remarkable ability of the host to maintain a homoeostasis in this community under widely different environments.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1365-2656\", \"ISSN: 0021-8790\", \"PMID: 22708631\", \"EISSN: 1365-2656\", \"DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2656.2012.02004.x\", \"CODEN: JAECAP\"]}\n",

Despite being taxonomically widespread, these routing behaviours remain poorly understood due to the difficulty of tracking the foraging history of animals in the wild. Here we examine how bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) develop and optimise traplines over large spatial scales by setting up an array of five artificial flowers arranged in a regular pentagon (50 m side length) and fitted with motion-sensitive video cameras to determine the sequence of visitation. Stable traplines that linked together all the flowers in an optimal sequence were typically established after a bee made 26 foraging bouts, during which time only about 20 of the 120 possible routes were tried. Radar tracking of selected flights revealed a dramatic decrease by 80% (ca. 1500 m) of the total travel distance between the first and the last foraging bout. When a flower was removed and replaced by a more distant one, bees engaged in localised search flights, a strategy that can facilitate the discovery of a new flower and its integration into a novel optimal trapline. Based on these observations, we developed and tested an iterative improvement heuristic to capture how bees could learn and refine their routes each time a shorter route is found. Our findings suggest that complex dynamic routing problems can be solved by small-brained animals using simple learning heuristics, without the need for a cognitive map.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1544-9173\", \"EISSN: 1545-7885\", \"ISSN: 1545-7885\", \"PMID: 23049479\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001392\"]}\n",

In this study, we report the coexistence of three mariner elements (Tnigmar-Si, Tnigmar-Mr, and Tnigmar-Mb) in the genome of a single species, Tapinoma nigerrimum (subfamily Dolichoderinae). Molecular evolutionary analyses of the nucleotide sequence data revealed a general agreement between the evolutionary history of most the elements and the ant species that harbour them, and suggest that they are at the vertical inactivation stage of the so-called Mariner Life Cycle. In contrast, significantly reduced levels of synonymous divergence between Mboumar and Tnigmar-Mb and between Myrmar and Botmar (a mariner element isolated from Bombus terrestris), relative to those observed between their hosts, suggest that these elements arrived to the species that host them by horizontal transfer, long after the species’ split. The horizontal transfer events for the two pairs of elements could be roughly dated within the last 2 million years and about 14 million years, respectively. As would be expected under this scenario, the coding sequences of the youngest elements, Tnigmar-Mb and Mboumar, are intact and, thus, potentially functional. Each mariner element has a different chromosomal distribution pattern according to their stage within the Mariner Life Cycle. Finally, a new defective transposable element (Azteca) has also been found inserted into the Tnigmar-Mr sequences showing that the ant genomes have been invaded by at least four different types of mariner elements.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00114-012-0982-5\", \"ISSN: 0028-1042\", \"PMID: 23097152\", \"EISSN: 1432-1904\"]}\n",

This review summarizes, for the first time, 15 years of research on the hazards of neonicotinoids to bees including honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees. The focus of the paper is on three different key aspects determining the risks of neonicotinoid field concentrations for bee populations: (1) the environmental neonicotinoid residue levels in plants, bees and bee products in relation to pesticide application, (2) the reported side-effects with special attention for sublethal effects, and (3) the usefulness for the evaluation of neonicotinoids of an already existing risk assessment scheme for systemic compounds. Although environmental residue levels of neonicotinoids were found to be lower than acute/chronic toxicity levels, there is still a lack of reliable data as most analyses were conducted near the detection limit and for only few crops. Many laboratory studies described lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids on the foraging behavior, and learning and memory abilities of bees, while no effects were observed in field studies at field-realistic dosages. The proposed risk assessment scheme for systemic compounds was shown to be applicable to assess the risk for side-effects of neonicotinoids as it considers the effect on different life stages and different levels of biological organization (organism versus colony). Future research studies should be conducted with field-realistic concentrations, relevant exposure and evaluation durations. Molecular markers may be used to improve risk assessment by a better understanding of the mode of action (interaction with receptors) of neonicotinoids in bees leading to the identification of environmentally safer compounds.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s10646-012-0863-x\", \"ISSN: 1573-3017\", \"EISSN: 1573-3017\", \"PMID: 22350105\", \"ISSN: 0963-9292\", \"CODEN: ECOTEL\"]}\n",

In spite of extremely low visitation rates to this early spring-flowering plant, the species is not pollen limited. Although the largest pollen loads are transferred by solitary bees, the key pollinators are bumblebees (mostly the most common species, Bombus terrestris and B. lapidarius) due to their seasonal and floral constancy, and tolerance of bad weather conditions. The current decline of the studied population seems not to be related to the species' pollination or breeding systems but to plant habitat loss.

Major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs) are the dominant proteinaceous component of royal jelly. One of them, MRJP1, was found to play a central role in honeybee queen development. Genes encoding MRJPs were reported to originate from a single originator, and several of them have evolved nutritive function. Phylogenetic analysis provides evidence that the same originator has multiplied independently in Nasonia and ant lineages. Here we show that bumblebees represent a transition species preserving a single-copy pre-multiplication stage of MRJP evolution. By exploring the single-copy BtRJPL gene, we found striking similarities with MRJPs of the honeybee such as gene structure and expression regulation. At the same time it turned out that BtRJPL does not fulfill criteria for functioning as a nutritive protein. Instead we found evidence that BtRJPL is involved in food digestion or modification, which appears to be the original MRJP function, at least in this lineage. Thus, the evolutionary pattern of MRJPs in hymenopterans constitutes an excellent example of a functional diversification combined with the origin of new properties followed by intensive gene duplication events.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1879-0240\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.ibmb.2012.05.003\", \"ISSN: 0965-1748\", \"PMID: 22617191\"]}\n",

Parasites were sampled from five different host species in two subsequent years. Population genetic tools were used to test for the several types of adaptation.

Using a trypanosome parasite of bumblebees, we ask how host quality and transmission networks relate to parasite population structure across host species, and thus the potential for the evolution of specialist strains adapted to different host species. Host species differed in quality, with parasite growth varying across host species. Highly asymmetric transmission networks, together with differences in host quality, likely explain local population structure of the parasite across host species. However, parasite population structure across years was highly dynamic, with parasite populations varying significantly from one year to the next within individual species at a given site. This suggests that, while host quality and transmission may provide the opportunity for short-term host specialization by the parasite, repeated bottlenecking of the parasite, in combination with its own reproductive biology, overrides these smaller scale effects, resulting in the evolution of a generalist parasite.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 23025597\", \"ISSN: 1558-5646\", \"DOI: 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01655.x\", \"ISSN: 0014-3820\", \"EISSN: 1558-5646\"]}\n",

Insects like honeybees and bumblebees use their colour and spatial vision to solve tasks, such as navigation, or to recognise rewarding flowers during foraging. Bee vision is one of the most intensively studied animal visual systems, and several models have been developed to describe its function. These models have largely assumed that bee vision is determined by mechanistic hard-wired circuits, with little or no consideration for behavioural plasticity or cognitive factors. However, recent work on both bee colour vision and spatial vision suggests that cognitive factors are indeed a very significant factor in determining what a bee sees. Individual bumblebees trade-off speed for accuracy, and will decide on which criteria to prioritise depending upon contextual information. With continued visual experience, honeybees can learn to use non-elemental processing, including configural mechanisms and rule learning, and can access top-down information to enhance learning of sophisticated, novel visual tasks. Honeybees can learn delayed-matching-to-sample tasks and the rules governing this decision making, and even transfer learned rules between different sensory modalities. Finally, bees can learn complex categorisation tasks and display numerical processing abilities for numbers up to and including four. Taken together, this evidence suggests that bees do have a capacity for sophisticated visual behaviours that fit a definition for cognition, and thus simple elemental models of bee vision need to take account of how a variety of factors may influence the type of results one may gain from animal behaviour experiments.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 22246247\", \"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\", \"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.038190\"]}\n",

Furthermore, response thresholds of individual workers may change over time through self-reinforcement (experience), such that workers become more sensitive to task stimuli. However, in addition to self-reinforcement, aging is another process that occurs through time. Distinguishing whether response thresholds change within workers due to self-reinforcement or aging may give insight into the flexibility of this task allocation mechanism. Using a ventilation paradigm, we manipulated workers of Bombus impatiens to have either repeated or lack of exposures to increases in nest air temperature, thereby allowing us to manipulate experience and thus self-reinforcement. Nest air temperature was the task stimulus, and ventilation (fanning) was the behavioral response. We found that ventilation response thresholds do not decrease either with age or experience in workers of B. impatiens, contrary to what has been reported for B. terrestris workers (Weidenmüller, 2004). Instead, we found high levels of intra-individual variation in response thresholds. Our results also show that workers with lower average response thresholds respond to heating events with higher probability than those with higher ventilation thresholds. These results provide insight into the role of the response threshold framework for task allocation; we also discuss how response probabilities may play a role in task allocation among workers.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1420-9098\", \"ISSN: 0020-1812\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s00040-011-0183-9\"]}\n",

The number of bees entering a foraging arena was positively correlated with food sucrose concentration (0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 M sucrose, equal to 16–65% w/w). Foragers spent significantly more time imbibing higher concentration solutions. Foragers then returned to the nest where they moved in elaborate paths at variable speeds.

On average, individuals foraging on 2.5 M and 1.0 M solution walked paths respectively 1.6 fold and 1.4 longer than the paths of individuals foraging on 0.5 M solution.

Using a pumpkin model system, we show that these drivers non‐additively affect flower morphology, phenology, flower sex ratios and nectar chemistry (sugar and amino acids), thereby altering the attractiveness of nectar to bumble bee pollinators and reducing worker longevity. Alarmingly, bees were attracted to, and consumed more, nectar from a treatment that reduced their survival by 22%.

We collected spectral data from 111 Australian native flowers and tested signal appearance considering the colour discrimination capabilities of potentially important pollinators. The highest frequency of flower reflectance curves is consistent with data reported for the Northern Hemisphere. The subsequent mapping of Australian flower reflectances into a bee colour space reveals a very similar distribution of flower colour evolution to the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, flowering plants in Australia are likely to have independently evolved spectral signals that maximize colour discrimination by hymenoptera. Moreover, we found that the degree of variability in flower coloration for particular angiosperm species matched the range of reflectance colours that can only be discriminated by bees that have experienced differential conditioning.

Here, we examined foraging patterns of Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski in late-season blooming clover in the agriculturaldominated Willamette Valley in Oregon. Workers from 10 fields collected over 2 yr were assigned to full sibling families (colonies) by using eight microsatellite loci. With estimation of numbers of unseen species, we inferred the presence of 189 colonies from 433 bees genotyped in year 1, and 144 from 296 genotyped the next year. Worker foraging distance was estimated to be at least 11.6 km, half the distance between the most remote fields visited by the same colonies. Numbers of nests contributing workers to each field ranged from 15 to 163. Overall, 165 (50%) colonies foraged in two or more fields, and thus used common resources within the landscape. Estimates of average nest densities in the landscape each year ranged from 0.76/km2 to 22.16/km2, and highlighted the influences of various study parameters incorporated into the calculation including sample size, distances between sites, and analytical tools used to estimate unsampled individuals.

The efficiency of a dog compared with human volunteers at finding nests in woodland, with the human volunteers using two methods: 'fixed searches' and 'free searches'. The two dogs varied in their efficiency in finding buried portions of bumble bee nest material (62.5% and 100% correct indications).

Fixed searches located nests more slowly (one nest for 3 h 18 min of searching time), but probably provide a reliable estimate of nest density.

Generalized food-deceptive (GFD) orchids compete poorly with rewarding species for pollinator services, which may be overcome by flowering early in the growing season when relatively more pollinators are naive and fewer competing plant species are flowering, and/or flowering for extended periods to enhance the chance of pollinator visits. We tested these hypotheses by manipulating flowering time and duration in a natural population of Calypso bulbosa and quantifying pollinator visitation based on pollen removal. Both early and long flowering increased bumble-bee visitation compared with late and brief flowering, respectively. To identify the cause of reduced visitation during late flowering, we tested whether negative experience with C. bulbosa (avoidance learning) and positive experience with a rewarding species, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, (associative learning) by captive bumble-bees could reduce C. bulbosa's competitiveness. Avoidance learning explained the higher visitation of early- compared with late-flowering C. bulbosa. The resulting pollinator-mediated selection for early flowering may commonly affect GFD orchids, explaining their tendency to flower earlier than rewarding orchids.

Pesticide regimes that threaten their sustainability should therefore be assessed. As an example, evidence that the agricultural use of neonicotinoid pesticides is a cause of the recently observed declines in honey bees is examined. The aim is to define exacting demographic conditions for a detrimental factor to precipitate a population decline, and Hill's epidemiological ‘causality criteria’ are employed as a structured process for making an expert judgement about the proposition that trace dietary neonicotinoids in nectar and pollen cause population declines in honey bees.RESULTS: In spite of the absence of decisive experimental results, the analysis shows that, while the proposition is a substantially justified conjecture in the context of current knowledge, it is also substantially contraindicated by a wide variety of circumstantial epidemiological evidence.CONCLUSION:It is concluded that dietary neonicotinoids cannot be implicated in honey bee declines, but this position is provisional because important gaps remain in current knowledge. Avenues for further investigations to resolve this longstanding uncertainty are therefore identified.

In insects it has been shown that differential conditioning is important for processing fine colour discriminations. However, the visual system of many insects, including the honeybee, has a complex set of neural pathways, in which input from the long wavelength sensitive ('green') photoreceptor may be processed either as an independent achromatic signal or as part of a trichromatic opponent-colour system. Thus, a potential confound of colour learning in insects is the possibility that modulation of the 'green' photoreceptor could underlie observations.\\nWe tested honeybee vision using light emitting diodes centered on 414 and 424 nm wavelengths, which limit activation to the short-wavelength-sensitive ('UV') and medium-wavelength-sensitive ('blue') photoreceptors. The absolute irradiance spectra of stimuli was measured and modelled at both receptor and colour processing levels, and stimuli were then presented to the bees in a Y-maze at a large visual angle (26°), to ensure chromatic processing. Sixteen bees were trained over 50 trials, using either appetitive differential conditioning (N = 8), or aversive-appetitive differential conditioning (N = 8). In both cases the bees slowly learned to discriminate between the target and distractor with significantly better accuracy than would be expected by chance. Control experiments confirmed that changing stimulus intensity in transfers tests does not significantly affect bee performance, and it was possible to replicate previous findings that bees do not learn similar colour stimuli with absolute conditioning.\\nOur data indicate that honeybee colour vision can be tuned to relatively small spectral differences, independent of 'green' photoreceptor contrast and brightness cues. We thus show that colour vision is at least partly experience dependent, and behavioural plasticity plays an important role in how bees exploit colour information.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 23155394\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0048577\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

In the present study, we use a classical genetics approach to examine the mode of inheritance of infection outcome in the crustacean Daphnia magna when exposed to the bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa. In contrast to previous studies in this system, we use a clone of P. ramosa, not field isolates, which allows for a more definitive interpretation of results. We test parental, F1, F2, backcross and selfed parental clones (total 284 genotypes) for susceptibility against a clone of P. ramosa using two different methods, infection trials and the recently developed attachment test. We find that D. magna clones reliably exhibit either complete resistance or complete susceptibility to P. ramosa clone C1 and that resistance is dominant, and inherited in a pattern consistent with Mendelian segregation of a single-locus with two alleles. The finding of a single host locus controlling susceptibility to P. ramosa suggests that the previously observed genotype-genotype interactions in this system have a simple genetic basis. This has important implications for the outcome of host-parasite co-evolution.

In this species, outbreeding winged sexuals and nest‐mating wingless sexuals mate during two separate reproductive periods. We show that regular sib‐matings lead to high levels of homozygosity and the occasional production of diploid males, which sporadically sire triploid offspring. On the individual level, inbreeding was associated with an increased body size in workers. On the colony level, we found no evidence for inbreeding depression as productivity was unaffected by the level of homozygosity. Instead, inbred colonies altered their allocation strategies by investing more resources into sexuals than into workers. This shift towards sexual production was due to an increased investment in both males and queens, which was particularly pronounced in the dispersive generation.

Therefore, unlike solitary insects, social species are expected to forage at rates that maximize colony fitness rather than individual fitness. Workers can increase the net benefit of foraging by responding to increased resource availability, by responding more strongly to higher‐quality resources, and by decreasing the uncertainty with which nestmates find resources. Unlike many ants and social bees, no social wasp is known to utilize a nest‐based recruitment signal to inform nestmates of food location. On the other hand, wasps do learn the odor of food brought to the nest and use this cue to locate the food source outside the nest. Here, we quantify the effects of three food‐associated variables on the allocation of foraging effort in the yellowjacket Vespula germanica. We used an experimental approach to assess whether resource quantity, quality, or associated olfactory information affect the probability that a forager will leave the nest on a foraging trip. We addressed these questions by inserting a known amount of sucrose solution directly into nests and recording foraging effort (departure rate) over the subsequent hour‐long observation period. No differences were found in foraging effort because of the presence/absence of olfactory cues, but there was strong evidence that foraging effort increased in response to resource influx and resource quality. Thus, while olfactory cues are learned in the nest, only resource quality and the cue of increased amount of food in the nest factor into a forager's decision of whether or not to depart on a foraging trip. However, as prior work has shown, once a wasp forager leaves the nest, it uses the learned olfactory cues to aid in finding resources.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1111/j.1439-0310.2012.02050.x\", \"ISSN: 0179-1613\", \"EISSN: 1439-0310\"]}\n",

We also studied the same traits in males collected from non-manipulated colonies with pollen reserves intermediate between the supplemented or reduced groups but with more workers and honey reserves. Males reared under experimentally reduced pollen reserves had significantly smaller bodies and lower sperm counts compared to those reared in colonies with experimentally supplemented pollen reserves. There was also a significantly positive relationship between the number of sperm and body size in males across all colony treatments. The maximum number of sperm in seminal vesicles was recorded 2 days later in males from colonies with reduced pollen compared to males from colonies with supplementary pollen. Males from non-manipulated colonies were intermediate in size, sperm count and speed of maturation.

However, relatively little is known about the degree to which individual bumble bees specialize on collecting nectar or pollen, when such preferences manifest, and if individuals can alter their foraging preferences in response to changes in the colony workforce. Using\\nBombus impatiens\\n, we monitored all foraging visits made by every bee in multiple colonies and showed that individual foragers exhibit consistent lifetime foraging preferences. Based upon the distribution of foraging preferences, we defined three forager types (pollen specialists, nectar specialists, and generalists). In unmanipulated colonies, 16–36 % of individuals specialized (≥90 % of visits) on nectar or pollen only. On its first day of foraging, an individual’s foraging choices (nectar only, pollen only, or nectar and pollen) significantly predicted its lifetime foraging preferences. Foragers that only collected pollen on their first day of foraging made 1.61- to 1.67-fold more lifetime pollen foraging visits (as a proportion of total trips) than foragers that only collected nectar on their first foraging day. Foragers were significantly larger than bees that stayed only in the nest. We also determined the effect of removing pollen specialists at early (brood present) or later (brood absent) stages in colony life. These results suggest that generalists can alter their foraging preferences in response to the loss of a small subset of foragers. Thus, bumble bees exhibit individual lifetime foraging preferences that are established early in life, but generalists may be able to adapt to colony needs.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 22965265\", \"ISSN: 0028-1042\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s00114-012-0964-7\", \"EISSN: 1432-1904\"]}\n",

When tested after removal of the panels, bumblebees reoriented using the residual information provided by the geometry of the cage.

Finally, when geometric and featural cues provided contradictory information, bumblebees showed more reliance on featural cues. A similar outcome was observed when the conflict between geometrical and featural information was determined by first training bumblebees in a rectangular cage with a single wall of a different color used as a feature, and then testing animals with the feature displaced along a different wall. When the feature was close to the goal during training, bumblebees chose the corners with the feature at test, when the feature was far from goal during training, bumblebees chose the corners with the correct geometry at test.

Bumblebee foragers show diurnal rhythms under daily light:dark cycles and short-period free-running circadian rhythms in constant light conditions in the laboratory. In contrast, during the continuous light conditions of the arctic summer, they show robust 24-h rhythms in their foraging patterns, meaning that some external zeitgeber must entrain their circadian clocks in the presence of constant light. Although the sun stays above the horizon for weeks during the arctic summer, the light quality, especially in the ultraviolet (UV) range, exhibits pronounced daily changes. Since the photoreceptors and photopigments that synchronize the circadian system of bees are not known, we tested if the circadian clocks of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) can be entrained by daily cycles in UV light levels. Bumblebee colonies were set up in the laboratory and exposed to 12 h:12 h UV + :UV− cycles in otherwise continuous lighting conditions by placing UV filters on their foraging arenas for 12 h each day. The activity patterns of individual bees were recorded using fully automatic radiofrequency identification (RFID). We found that colonies manipulated in such a way showed synchronized 24-h rhythms, whereas simultaneously tested control colonies with no variation in UV light levels showed free-running rhythms instead. The results of our study show that bumblebee circadian rhythms can indeed be synchronized by daily cycles in ambient light spectral composition.

We confirmed and extend the evidence that in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris the adult bee body size is positively correlated with colony age. We next performed cross-fostering experiments in which eggs were switched between incipient (before worker emergence) and later stage colonies with workers. The introduced eggs developed into adults similar in size to their unrelated nestmates and not to their same-age full sisters developing in their mother colony. Detailed observations revealed that brood tending by the queen decreases, but does not cease, in young colonies with workers. We next showed that both worker number and the queen presence influenced the final size of the developing brood, but only the queen influence was mediated by shortening developmental time. In colonies separated by a queen excluder, brood developmental time was shorter in the queenright compartment. These findings suggest that differences in body size are regulated by the brood interactions with the queen and workers, and not by factors inside the eggs that could vary along with colony development. Finally, we developed a model showing that the typical increase in worker number and the decrease in brood contact with the queen can account for the typical increase in body size.

In harnessed workers of B. terrestris, a concentration of 5.5% of fructose and glucose was required to induce the proboscis extension reflex in 50% of the workers, whereas for sucrose, a much higher concentration of 40% was needed. In contrast, free-moving workers given a choice between 30% glucose, 30% sucrose, 30% fructose, and water showed a strong preference for sucrose (66% of individuals) compared with 18% for glucose and 16% for fructose; water was never chosen. Familiarization with 30% fructose provoked a significant increase in preference toward fructose, indicating plasticity. In addition, by amputation of the tarsi, it was found that tarsi plays a role in the sugar response with especially the foreleg tarsi being involved in the response to fructose.

To understand how ground-nesting bumblebees might implement such a matching process, we have video-recorded the bees' learning and return flights and analysed the similarities and differences between the principal motifs of their flights. Loops that take bees away from and bring them back towards the nest are common during learning flights and less so in return flights. Zigzags are more prominent on return flights. Both motifs tend to be nest based. Bees often both fly towards and face the nest in the middle of loops and at the turns of zigzags. Before and after flight direction and body orientation are aligned, the two diverge from each other so that the nest is held within the bees' fronto-lateral visual field while flight direction relative to the nest can fluctuate more widely. These and other parallels between loops and zigzags suggest that they are stable variations of an underlying pattern, which enable bees to store and reacquire similar nest-focused views during learning and return flights.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 23447668\", \"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\", \"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.081455\"]}\n",

Different genotypes of a parasite species can differ in infectivity and virulence; which is important for host-parasite co-evolutionary processes, such as antagonistic, fluctuating selection. Such coevolution obviously requires a genetic basis, but little is known about how hosts immunologically respond to different genotypes. The common European bumblebee Bombus terrestris is infected by the highly prevalent trypanosome gut parasite, Crithidia bombi. Here we examined expression of 26 immunological and metabolic genes in response to infection by two clones of C. bombi and compared that with exposure to injection with a bacterial challenge. Exposure to the two clones of C. bombi elicits qualitatively different immune expression responses. Interestingly, infection with one clone results in up regulation of AMP’s similar to bees given the bacterial challenge, while genes related to metabolism, signalling, and other effectors were similar between the two Crithidia exposures. Bees given different challenges were distinct enough to discern using linear discriminant analyses. We also found strong correlations, both positive and negative, among genes, which may shed light on how suites of genes are regulated and trade-offs in expression within this gene set.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1567-7257\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.meegid.2013.09.014\", \"PMID: 24055962\", \"ISSN: 1567-1348\"]}\n",

However, it has not been quantified what roles phototransduction and membrane properties play in such diversity. Here, we use electrophysiological methods in combination with system analysis to study whether the membrane properties could create the variation of the response speed found in the bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) photoreceptors. We recorded intracellular responses from each photoreceptor class to white noise-modulated current stimuli and defined their input resistance and linear filtering properties. We found that green sensitive cells exhibit smaller input resistance and membrane impedance than other cell classes. Since green sensitive cells are the fastest photoreceptor class in the bumblebee retina, our results suggest that the membrane filtering properties are correlated with the speed of light responses across the spectral classes.

We deliberately included natural variation of the host \\\"environment\\\" by using bees from colonies collected in two locations and sampling active foraging workers that were not age controlled. Immune gene expression patterns in response to C. bombi showed remarkable variability even among genetically similar sisters. Nevertheless, expression varied with parasite exposure, among colonies and, perhaps surprisingly, strongly among populations (collection sites). While only the antimicrobial peptide abaecin is universally up regulated upon exposure, linear discriminant analysis suggests that the overall exposure effect is driven by a combination of several immune pathways and further immune functions such as ROS regulation. Also, the differences among colonies in their immune gene expression profiles provide clues to the mechanistic basis of well-known inter-colony variation in susceptibility to this parasite.

Early in the founding phase, prior to the emergence of workers in the nest, queens are reproductive and also provision and feed their offspring. However, later in the founding phase, queens reduce their feeding of larvae and become specialized on reproduction. This transition is synchronized with the emergence of workers in the colony, who assume the task of feeding their siblings. Using a social manipulation experiment with the bumble bee Bombus terrestris, we tested the hypothesis that workers regulate the transition from feeding brood to specialization on reproduction in nest-founding bumble bee queens. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that early-stage nest-founding queens with workers prematurely added to their nests reduce their brood-feeding behavior and increase egg laying, and likewise, late-stage nest-founding queens increase their brood-feeding behavior and decrease egg-laying when workers are removed from their nests. Further, brood-feeding and egg-laying behaviors were negatively correlated. We used Agilent microarrays designed from B. terrestris brain expressed sequenced tags (ESTs) to explore a second hypothesis, that workers alter brain gene expression in nest-founding queens. We found evidence that brain gene expression in nest-founding queens is altered by the presence of workers, with the effect being much stronger in late-stage founding queens.

This study aimed to quantify the occurrence of natal-worker reproduction, worker drift and drifter reproduction within 14 wild colonies of Bombus terrestris in Central Scotland. Four unlinked microsatellites were used to identify patterns of relatedness of the colonies' adults and broods. In colonies with queens (queenright colonies), worker reproduction accounted for just 0.83 % of males, increasing to 12.11 % in queenless colonies. Four colonies contained a total of six workers which were not daughters of the queen, and were assumed to be drifters, and four male offspring of drifters. Drifting is clearly not common and results in few drifter offspring overall, although drifters produced approximately seven times more offspring per capita than workers that remained in their natal colony. Unexpectedly, two colonies contained clusters of sister workers and juvenile offspring that were not sisters to the rest of the adults or brood found in the colonies, demonstrating probable egg dumping by queens. A third colony contained a queen which was not a sister or daughter to the other bees in the colony. Although usurping of bumblebee colonies by queens in early season is well documented, this appears to be the first record of egg dumping, and it remains unclear whether it is being carried out by old queens or newly mated young queens.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00265-013-1481-1\", \"EISSN: 1432-0762\", \"ISSN: 0340-5443\"]}\n",

This is generally mediated by behavioural hierarchy that reduces the cost of within-group aggression. Aggressive behaviour and ovarian development are thus two co-occurring correlates of reproductive skew, but their mutual influence remains unclear. Here we examined the interplay between these factors by constructing a simulation model, based on the biology of Bombus terrestris, to test whether aggression levels are determined by the level of ovarian development or vice versa. We approached this question using virtual groups composed of either equally or unequally matched workers, as well as supplementing the simulation data by experimental data using actual bee groups. The simulation revealed that previous encounter experience (win/lose) rather than mutual assessment of reproductive status determines and maintains hierarchy in B. terrestris. Furthermore, although bumblebee workers largely vary in their aggression tendencies, pre-existing differences between nest-mates were not obligatory for establishment of the hierarchy. The initially formed linear hierarchy became polynomial after 10 days, clearly separating between egg-laying workers and helpers. This was consistent with the results obtained for actual bee groups. We propose that aggressive behaviour and the outcome of previous encounters are major determinants of ovarian development and not vice versa. Workers may gain a head start in the competition due to variation in their innate aggressive tendencies, or by fortuitously winning their first encounters. Small differences in aggressiveness between workers are amplified to initially form a short-term linear hierarchy that subsequently turns to polynomial hierarchy, creating the most basic phenomenon of social groups, reproductive division of labor.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00040-013-0285-7\", \"EISSN: 1420-9098\", \"ISSN: 0020-1812\"]}\n",

Although buzz-pollination is widespread in angiosperms with over 20,000 species using it, little is known about the functional connection between natural variation in buzzing vibrations and the amount of pollen that can be extracted from anthers. We characterized variability in the vibrations produced by Bombus terrestris bumblebees while collecting pollen from Solanum rostratum (Solanaceae), a buzz-pollinated plant. We found substantial variation in several buzzing properties both within and among workers from a single colony. As expected, some of this variation was predicted by the physical attributes of individual bumblebees: heavier workers produced buzzes of greater amplitude. We then constructed artificial \\\"pollination buzzes\\\" that varied in three parameters (peak frequency, peak amplitude, and duration), and stimulated S. rostratum flowers with these synthetic buzzes to quantify the relationship between buzz properties and pollen removal. We found that greater amplitude and longer duration buzzes ejected substantially more pollen, while frequency had no directional effect and only a weak quadratic effect on the amount of pollen removed. These findings suggest that foraging bumblebees may improve pollen collection by increasing the duration or amplitude of their buzzes. Moreover, given that amplitude is positively correlated with mass, preferential foraging by heavier workers is likely to result in the largest pollen yields per bee, and this could have significant consequences for the success of a colony foraging on buzz-pollinated flowers.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1432-1939\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s00442-012-2535-1\", \"ISSN: 0029-8549\", \"PMID: 23188056\", \"CODEN: OECOBX\"]}\n",

While phenotypic differentiation in characters, such as size or shape among insular organisms, has been well studied, insular differentiation in quantitative reproductive traits involved in chemical communication has received very little attention to date. Here, we investigated the impact of insularity on two syntopic bumblebee species pairs: one including species that are phylogenetically related (Bombus terrestris and B. lucorum), and the other including species that interact ecologically (B. terrestris and its specific nest inquiline B. vestalis). For each bumblebee species, we characterized the patterns of variation and differentiation of insular (Corsican) vs. mainland (European) populations (i) with four genes (nuclear and mitochondrial, 3781 bp) and (ii) in the chemical composition of male marking secretions (MMS), a key trait for mate attraction in bumblebees, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Our results provide evidence for genetic differentiation in Corsican bumblebees and show that, contrary to theoretical expectations, island populations of bumblebees exhibit levels of genetic variation similar to the mainland populations. Likewise, our comparative chemical analyses of MMS indicate that Corsican populations of bumblebees are significantly differentiated from the mainland yet they hold comparative levels of within-population MMS variability compared to the mainland. Therefore, insularity has led Corsican populations to diverge both genetically and chemically from their mainland relatives, presumably through genetic drift, but without a decrease of genetic diversity in island populations. We hypothesize that MMS divergence in Corsican bumblebees was driven by a persistent lack of gene flow with mainland populations and reinforced by the preference of Corsican females for sympatric (Corsican) MMS. The impoverished Corsican bumblebee fauna has not led to relaxation of stabilizing selection on MMS but to consistent differentiation chemical reproductive traits on the island.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0065642\", \"PMID: 23755263\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

Specifically, we asked whether A. bombi, recently identified in Argentina, was introduced by European, non-native bees. Using ITS1 and ITS2 to assess the parasite's intraspecific genetic variation in bees from Argentina and Europe, we found a largely unstructured parasite population, with only 15% of the genetic variation being explained by geographic location. The most abundant haplotype in Argentina (found in all 9 specimens of non-native species) was identical to the most abundant haplotype in Europe (found in 6 out of 8 specimens). Similarly, there was no evidence of structuring by host species, with this factor explaining only 17% of the genetic variation. Interestingly, parasites in native Bombus ephippiatus from Mexico were genetically distant from the Argentine and European samples, suggesting that sufficient variability does exist in the ITS region to identify continent-level genetic structure in the parasite. Thus, the data suggest that A. bombi from Argentina and Europe share a common, relatively recent origin. Although our data did not provide information on the direction of transfer, the absence of genetic structure across space and host species suggests that A. bombi may be acting as an emergent infectious disease across bee taxa and continents.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 24324696\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0081475\"]}\n",

Guarding the nest to prevent the intrusion of parasites is a widespread response of host species. If absolute rejection of strangers provides the best protection against parasites, more fine-tuned strategies can prove more adaptive. Guarding is indeed costly and not all strangers constitute a real threat. That is particularly true for worker reproductive parasitism in social insects since only a fraction of non-nestmate visitors, the fertile ones, can readily engage in parasitic reproduction. Guards should thus be more restrictive towards fertile than sterile non-nestmate workers. We here tested this hypothesis by examining the reaction of nest-entrance guards towards nestmate and non-nestmate workers with varying fertility levels in the bumble bee Bombus terrestris. Because social recognition in social insects mainly relies on cuticular lipids (CLs), chemical analysis was also conducted to examine whether workers’ CLs could convey the relevant information upon which guards could base their decision. We thus aimed to determine whether an adapted defensive strategy to worker reproductive parasitism has evolved in B. terrestris colonies. RESULTS: Chemical analysis revealed that the cuticular chemical profiles of workers encode information about both their colony membership and their current fertility, therefore providing potential recognition cues for a suitable adjustment of the guards’ defensive decisions. We found that guards were similarly tolerant towards sterile non-nestmate workers than towards nestmate workers. However, as predicted, guards responded more aggressively towards fertile non-nestmates. CONCLUSION: Our results show that B. terrestris guards discriminate non-nestmates that differ in their reproductive potential and respond more strongly to the individuals that are a greatest threat for the colony. Cuticular hydrocarbons are the probable cues underlying the specific recognition of reproductive parasites, with the specific profile of highly fertile bees eliciting the agonistic response when combined with non-colony membership information. Our study therefore provides a first piece of empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis that an adapted defensive strategy against worker reproductive parasitism exists in B. terrestris colonies.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1742-9994\", \"DOI: 10.1186/1742-9994-10-74\", \"ISSN: 1742-9994\", \"PMID: 24321042\"]}\n",

Emergent diseases are one of the major threats to biodiversity and a microsporidian parasite, Nosema ceranae, has recently jumped host from the Asian to the Western honeybee, spreading rapidly worldwide, and contributing to dramatic colony losses. Bumblebees are ecologically and economically important pollinators of conservation concern, which are likely exposed to N. ceranae by sharing flowers with honeybees. Whilst a further intergeneric jump by N. ceranae to infect bumblebees would be potentially serious, its capacity to do this is unknown. Here we investigate the prevalence of N. ceranae in wild bumblebees in the UK and determine the infectivity of the parasite under controlled conditions. We found N. ceranae in all seven wild bumblebee species sampled, and at multiple sites, with many of the bees having spores from this parasite in their guts. When we fed N. ceranae spores to bumblebees under controlled conditions, we confirmed that the parasite can infect bumblebees. Infections spread from the midgut to other tissues, reduced bumblebee survival by 48% and had sub-lethal effects on behaviour. Although spore production appeared lower in bumblebees than in honeybees, virulence was greater. The parasite N. ceranae therefore represents a real and emerging threat to bumblebees, with the potential to have devastating consequences for their already vulnerable populations.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1096-0805\", \"CODEN: JIVPAZ\", \"PMID: 23816821\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.jip.2013.06.005\", \"ISSN: 0022-2011\"]}\n",

In this context, tests were conducted with the insecticide chlorantraniliprole (Coragen®) as a model compound active on the ryanodine receptor of insects.\\nRESULTS\\nChronic oral exposure via pollen induced lethargic behaviour in B. terrestris workers and their offspring (drones). Indeed, in nests exposed to 0.4 mg L−1, representing 1/100 of the concentration recommended for use in the field, workers and drones did not take their defensive position upon stimulation and they were less active than non‐exposed insects. The different risk assessment tests used here demonstrated that contact and pollen exposure had no effect on bumblebee worker survival, whereas oral exposure via sugar water caused both acute (72 h LC50 = 13 mg L−1) and chronic (7 week LC50 = 7 mg L−1) toxicity.

Our understanding of individual response behaviour and how it is integrated into a functioning colony is still patchy. Most theoretical studies addressing this question are based on the assumption that workers have intrinsic and often fixed response thresholds for task-related stimuli. Here, we investigated the plasticity in worker fanning response behaviour in a bumblebee, Bombus terrestris. Using a temperature-controlled brood dummy, we first asked whether the fanning response is modulated by rate of temperature change. Second, we examined to what extent the fanning response is influenced by recent fanning experience. Our results show that the individual fanning response is modulated by both the rate of temperature increase and recent experience. Workers responded at lower temperatures and with a higher probability when the temperature of the brood dummy increased slowly compared with more rapid temperature increases. Workers that repeatedly responded to an increase in brood dummy temperature with fanning showed a significant decrease in their response thresholds, whereas the response thresholds of control workers that experienced the same treatment but did not gather fanning experience remained unchanged. The decrease in response threshold was pronounced when the time interval between two successive fanning events was less than 6h. When 16h or more separated fanning events, individual fanning responses returned to higher threshold levels. We suggest that experience-dependent modulation of response thresholds plays an important role in the behavioural differentiation of workers and the flexibility of insect colonies.\\n► Bumblebee workers control the temperature of their brood by incubating and fanning. ► Using a brood dummy, we investigated the plasticity in the individual fanning response. ► Fanning response behaviour is modulated by rate of temperature increase. ► Fanning response thresholds are modulated by previous experience in task performance. ► The effect of experience depends on the time interval between task performances.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1095-8282\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.10.003\", \"ISSN: 0003-3472\", \"CODEN: ANBEA8\"]}\n",

To address this hypothesis, we isolated and functionally characterized FADs from three bumblebee species: Bombus lucorum, Bombus terrestris, and Bombus lapidarius. By employing RNA sequencing of the male labial glands and fat bodies of B. lucorum and B. terrestris, we identified five paralogous FAD-like sequences but only two FAD lineages were abundant and differentially expressed in the labial glands. We found that abundant FAD lineages were also expressed in the labial gland and fat body of Bombus lapidarius. Functional characterization of FADs in a yeast expression system confirmed that Δ4-FADs exhibited a unique Δ4-desaturase activity exclusively on 14-carbon fatty acyls and Δ9-FADs displayed Δ9-desaturase activity on 14- to 18-carbon fatty acyls. These results indicate that Δ9-FADs are involved in the biosynthesis of major unsaturated components of MPs in B. lucorum and B. lapidarius despite the diverse MP composition of these bumblebee species.

Few studies however, have investigated bee visual search for multiple target types after extended learning and controlling for prior visual experience. We trained colour-naive bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) extensively in separate discrimination tasks to recognise two rewarding colours in interspersed block training sessions. We then tested them with both colours simultaneously in the presence of distracting colours to examine whether and how quickly they were able to switch between the target colours. We found that bees switched between visual targets quickly and often. The median time taken to switch between targets was shorter than known estimates of how long traces last in bees' working memory suggesting that their capacity to recall more than one learned target was not restricted by working memory limitations. Following our results, we propose a model of memory and learning that integrates our findings with previous studies investigating flower constancy.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\", \"PMID: 23948481\", \"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.085456\"]}\n",

Social bees provide a good model for this and, whilst there are published descriptions of their behaviour on initial learning flights close to the colony, it is still unclear how bees find floral resources over hundreds of metres and how these flights become directed foraging trips. We investigated the spatial ecology of exploration by radar tracking bumblebees, and comparing the flight trajectories of bees with differing experience. The bees left the colony within a day or two of eclosion and flew in complex loops of ever-increasing size around the colony, exhibiting Lévy-flight characteristics constituting an optimal searching strategy. This mathematical pattern can be used to predict how animals exploring individually might exploit a patchy landscape. The bees' groundspeed, maximum displacement from the nest and total distance travelled on a trip increased significantly with experience. More experienced bees flew direct paths, predominantly flying upwind on their outward trips although forage was available in all directions. The flights differed from those of naïve honeybees: they occurred at an earlier age, showed more complex looping, and resulted in earlier returns of pollen to the colony. In summary bumblebees learn to find home and food rapidly, though phases of orientation, learning and searching were not easily separable, suggesting some multi-tasking.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0078681\", \"PMID: 24265707\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

In this study we investigated whether A. bombi is acting as an emergent parasite in the non-native populations. Specifically, we asked whether A. bombi, recently identified in Argentina, was introduced by European, non-native bees. Using ITS1 and ITS2 to assess the parasite's intraspecific genetic variation in bees from Argentina and Europe, we found a largely unstructured parasite population, with only 15% of the genetic variation being explained by geographic location. The most abundant haplotype in Argentina (found in all 9 specimens of non-native species) was identical to the most abundant haplotype in Europe (found in 6 out of 8 specimens). Similarly, there was no evidence of structuring by host species, with this factor explaining only 17% of the genetic variation. Interestingly, parasites in native Bombus ephippiatus from Mexico were genetically distant from the Argentine and European samples, suggesting that sufficient variability does exist in the ITS region to identify continent-level genetic structure in the parasite. Thus, the data suggest that A. bombi from Argentina and Europe share a common, relatively recent origin. Although our data did not provide information on the direction of transfer, the absence of genetic structure across space and host species suggests that A. bombi may be acting as an emergent infectious disease across bee taxa and continents.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0081475\"]}\n",

Workers’ reproductive decisions thus need to be investigated to assess the extent of workers’ reproductive options. Here, we show in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris that drifting is a distinct strategy by which fertile workers circumvent competition in their nest and reproduce in foreign colonies. By monitoring workers’ movements between colonies, we show that drifting is a remarkably dynamic behaviour, widely expressed by both fertile and infertile workers. We demonstrate that a high fertility is, however, central in determining the propensity of workers to enter foreign colonies as well as their subsequent reproduction in host colonies. Moreover, our study shows that the drifting of fertile workers reflects complex decision-making processes associated with in-nest reproductive competition. This novel finding therefore adds to our modern conception of cooperation by showing the previously overlooked importance of alternative strategies which enable workers to assert their reproductive interests.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 24068358\", \"ISSN: 1471-2954\", \"EISSN: 1471-2945\", \"ISSN: 0962-8452\", \"DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2013.1888\", \"EISSN: 1471-2954\"]}\n",

We used mass-flowering oilseed rape fields as locations to sample bees of this complex, as well as the second most common visitor to oilseed rape B. lapidarius, and molecular RFLP methods to distinguish between the cryptic species. We then used microsatellite genotyping to identify sisters and estimate colony densities, and related both proportions of cryptic species and their colony densities to the composition of the landscape surrounding the fields. We found B. lucorum was the most common member of the complex present in oilseed rape followed by B. terrestris. B. cryptarum was also present in all but one site, with higher proportions found in the east of the study area. High numbers of bumblebee colonies were estimated to be using oilseed rape fields as a forage resource, with B. terrestris colony numbers higher than previous estimates from non-mass-flowering fields. We also found that the cryptic species responded differently to surrounding landscape composition: both relative proportions of B. cryptarum in samples and colony densities of B. lucorum were negatively associated with the amount of arable land in the landscape, while proportions and colony densities of other species did not respond to landscape variables at the scale measured. This suggests that the cryptic species have different ecological requirements (which may be scale-dependent) and that oilseed rape can be an important forage resource for many colonies of bumblebees.

While phenotypic differentiation in characters, such as size or shape among insular organisms, has been well studied, insular differentiation in quantitative reproductive traits involved in chemical communication has received very little attention to date. Here, we investigated the impact of insularity on two syntopic bumblebee species pairs: one including species that are phylogenetically related (Bombus terrestris and B. lucorum), and the other including species that interact ecologically (B. terrestris and its specific nest inquiline B. vestalis). For each bumblebee species, we characterized the patterns of variation and differentiation of insular (Corsican) vs. mainland (European) populations (i) with four genes (nuclear and mitochondrial, 3781 bp) and (ii) in the chemical composition of male marking secretions (MMS), a key trait for mate attraction in bumblebees, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Our results provide evidence for genetic differentiation in Corsican bumblebees and show that, contrary to theoretical expectations, island populations of bumblebees exhibit levels of genetic variation similar to the mainland populations. Likewise, our comparative chemical analyses of MMS indicate that Corsican populations of bumblebees are significantly differentiated from the mainland yet they hold comparative levels of within-population MMS variability compared to the mainland. Therefore, insularity has led Corsican populations to diverge both genetically and chemically from their mainland relatives, presumably through genetic drift, but without a decrease of genetic diversity in island populations. We hypothesize that MMS divergence in Corsican bumblebees was driven by a persistent lack of gene flow with mainland populations and reinforced by the preference of Corsican females for sympatric (Corsican) MMS.

Their foraging ability relies on the individual morphology, task allocation within the colony, and external factors, such as light intensity. The foraging activities of commercial bumblebees can sometimes be impaired, especially in the artificial and weak light intensities of greenhouses at high altitudes. Here we investigated whether the eagerness (or willingness) to forage of bumblebee colonies in different light conditions is correlated with the light sensitivity of bumblebees colonies and/or different external morphological parameters. The initial foraging capacity of bumblebee colonies correlated with their light sensitivity. However, light sensitive bumblebee colonies did not necessarily had a higher foraging activity at lower light intensities. Differences in initial foraging capacity and light sensitivity among colonies could not be explained by the external morphological parameters. In conclusion, our data illustrated that the recruitment to forage in artificial low light is less impaired in light sensitive colonies, and that not only the external morphology parameters determine the light sensitivity of bumblebees and their eagerness to forage in weak light conditions. The data obtained here create a better understanding of which criteria are able to select towards light sensitive bumblebees and their link with the foraging capacity of these bumblebees.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0022-1910\", \"PMID: 23834824\", \"EISSN: 1879-1611\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.jinsphys.2013.06.012\"]}\n",

Recent studies from North America suggest that disease transmission from commercially reared bumble bees to wild populations has led to marked range contractions in some species. In Europe, data on the prevalence of pathogen spillover from commercial to wild bumble bee populations is lacking, despite the widespread production and transport of hives within the EU since the early 1980s. We determined the permeability of cropping systems to commercial bumble bees, and quantified the prevalence of four pathogens in commercial Bombus terrestris hives and adjacent conspecific populations at increasing distances from greenhouses in Ireland. Commercial bumble bees collected from 31% to 97% of non-crop pollen, depending on the cropping system, and hives had markedly higher frequencies of two gut parasites, Crithidia spp. and Nosema bombi, compared to adjacent populations, but were free of tracheal mites. The highest prevalence of Crithida was observed within 2km of greenhouses and the probability of infection declined in a host sex- and pathogen-specific manner up to 10km.

Minoring allows tracking of potential alternative resources that might become more profitable with time. This is expected to provide an adaptive benefit under unstable foraging conditions, but to reduce foraging efficiency when resources are steady. We tested how predictability of food sources affects minoring and foraging success, using Bombus terrestris workers that fed on sucrose solution in artificial flowers. Bees exposed to three colour-distinct flower types with fluctuating food rewards performed more minoring (visits to a fourth, nonrewarding flower type) than bees that encountered a stable reward schedule. This difference was mostly due to a higher frequency of flower type shifts in the fluctuating-reward treatment. Flowers of the highest-rewarding type were visited less frequently in the fluctuating-reward than in the stable-reward treatment. This suggests that the fluctuating-reward schedule limited the bees' ability to track the most profitable flower type. Intervals between successive visits were longer in the fluctuating-reward than in the stable-reward treatment, possibly because the fluctuating schedule required time-consuming neural processing. As expected, the number of minoring visits correlated negatively with the number of colour shifts and with foraging success in the stable-reward treatment. In the fluctuating-reward treatment, on the other hand, sucrose intake rates were independent of minoring and colour shift frequencies. We suggest that novelty seeking by foragers can evolve when food sources offer fluctuating rewards, which reduce foraging success but also the cost of exploring new resources.\\n•Foraging bumblebees track their food sources by occasionally sampling them.•Artificial flowers with fluctuating rewards induced more sampling than stable ones.•Sampling was negatively correlated with foraging success when rewards were stable.•It was uncorrelated with foraging success when the flowers' profitability fluctuated.•Sampling of low-reward flowers (‘minoring’) can evolve in fluctuating environments.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1095-8282\", \"ISSN: 0003-3472\", \"CODEN: ANBEA8\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.07.010\"]}\n",

We investigated whether bees, Bombus terrestris, can efficiently discriminate similar flower colours while exposed to predation threat from cryptic predators. Bees were individually tested in tightly controlled laboratory experiments using artificial flowers whose nectar supply was administered with precision pumps. Predation risk was simulated by automated crab spider ‘robots’ that captured bees for a limited duration without injuring them. Bees' behaviour was monitored by a 3D video tracking system. We experimented with both cryptic and conspicuous spiders, finding that bees had no difficulty avoiding conspicuous spiders while still foraging adaptively. Conversely, they prioritized predator avoidance at the expense of maximizing energy intake when faced with detecting cryptic predators and a difficult colour discrimination task. This difference in behaviour was not due to cognitive limitations: bees were able to discriminate between similar flower types under predation risk from cryptic spiders when choosing the safe flower type incurred a gustatory punishment in the form of bitter quinine solution. However, this resulted in bees incurring substantially higher costs in terms of floral inspection times. We conclude that bees have the capacity to attend to difficult foraging tasks while simultaneously avoiding cryptic predators, but only do so when avoidance of gustatory punishment justifies the increased costs.\\n•We ask if bees maintain efficient foraging in the presence of cryptic predators.•Bumblebees prioritize detection of cryptic predators over maximizing energy intake.•Bumblebees maximize energy intake when predators are highly conspicuous.•Bees attend to both complex visual tasks when incentivized by punishment.•Discriminating floral colour and detecting cryptic predators is temporally costly.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1095-8282\", \"ISSN: 0003-3472\", \"CODEN: ANBEA8\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.07.029\"]}\n",

Each farm was visited monthly throughout the summer and workers of B. terrestris, B. pratorum, B. pascuorumand B. lapidarius were captured. The faeces of these bees were inspected for the gut microparasites Crithidia spp., Nosema bombi and Apicystis bombi.

The prevalence of A. bombi and N. bombi was too low to analyse. The prevalence and abundance of Crithidia spp. was significantly different among bumble bee species. Overall, the prevalence of Crithidia spp. was initially lower on farms deploying commercial bumble bees, possibly due to a dilution effect caused by the high density of imported bees. Crithidia spp. prevalence in Bombus terrestris, however, rose sharply on commercial farms at the end of the season. One potential explanation is that commercial bumble bees contract the local pathogen, which is then rapidly transmitted among them due to the high bee density. Whilst our data provide no evidence of pathogen spillover to wild species, it would be premature to conclude with certainty that commercial colonies do not represent a disease risk to native bees in the UK and we urge further studies into this phenomenon.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0021-8839\", \"EISSN: 2078-6913\", \"DOI: 10.3896/IBRA.1.52.3.06\"]}\n",

Nevertheless, if we want to infer from behavioural data how the visual system operates, it is important to know how different learning protocols affect performance and to devise protocols that minimise noise in the response of experimental subjects. The purpose of this work was to investigate how reinforcement schedule and individual variability affect the learning process in a colour discrimination task. Free-flying bumblebees were trained to discriminate between two perceptually similar colours. The target colour was associated with sucrose solution, and the distractor could be associated with water or quinine solution throughout the experiment, or with one substance during the first half of the experiment and the other during the second half. Both acquisition and final performance of the discrimination task (measured as proportion of correct choices) were determined by the choice of reinforcer during the first half of the experiment: regardless of whether bees were trained with water or quinine during the second half of the experiment, bees trained with quinine during the first half learned the task faster and performed better during the whole experiment. Our results confirm that the choice of stimuli used during training affects the rate at which colour discrimination tasks are acquired and show that early contact with a strongly aversive stimulus can be sufficient to maintain high levels of attention during several hours. On the other hand, bees which took more time to decide on which flower to alight were more likely to make correct choices than bees which made fast decisions. This result supports the existence of a trade-off between foraging speed and accuracy, and highlights the importance of measuring choice latencies during behavioural experiments focusing on cognitive abilities.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 23951186\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0071551\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

Conflicts over reproduction are partially regulated by a group of octyl esters that are produced in Dufour’s gland of reproductively subordinate workers and protect them from being aggressed. However, workers possess octyl esters even before overt aggression occurs, raising the question of why produce the ester-signal before it is functionally necessary?\\nIn most insect societies, foragers show reduced aggression and low dominance rank. We hypothesize that ester production in B. terrestris is not only correlated with sterility but also with foraging, signaling cooperative behavior by subordinate workers. Such a signal helps to maintain social organization, reduce the cost of fights between reproductives and helpers, and increase colony productivity, enabling subordinates to gain greater inclusive fitness. We demonstrate that foragers produce larger amounts of esters compared to non-foragers, and that their amounts positively correlate with foraging efforts. We further suggest that task performance, potential fecundity, and aggression are interlinked, and that worker–worker interactions are involved in regulating foraging behavior.\\nB. terrestris, being an intermediate phase between primitive and derived eusocial insects, provides an excellent model for understanding the evolution of early phases of eusociality. Our results, combined with those in primitively eusocial wasps, suggest that at early stages of social evolution, reproduction was regulated by a “primordial division of labor”, that comprised foragers and reproducers, which further evolved to a more complex division of labor, a hallmark of eusociality.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0022-1910\", \"EISSN: 1879-1611\", \"PMID: 24100232\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.jinsphys.2013.09.007\"]}\n",

Social animals possess an additional cue to detect such contaminated food sources: information provided by conspecifics. Bumblebees avoid contaminated flowers, but the cues used by the bees to distinguish contamination remain unknown. Under controlled laboratory conditions, we tested the use of scent marks derived from other foragers in choosing between a contaminated (by Crithidia bombi) and an uncontaminated flower. As a positive control we tested the bee's choice between two flowers, one scented with geraniol and containing a highly rewarding sugar solution, and the other not scented and containing a poorer reward. The bees mainly chose the uncontaminated and the rewarding scented flowers. Scent marks did not increase the efficiency of the bumblebees in choosing the better flower. The bees from both experiments behaved similarly, showing that the main and most relevant cue used to choose the uncontaminated flower is the odour from the parasite itself. The adaptation of bumblebees to avoid flowers contaminated by C. bombi arose from the long-term host-parasite interaction between these species. This strong adaptation results in an innate behaviour of bees and a detection and aversion of the odour of contaminated flower nectar.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\", \"PMID: 23038725\", \"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.075374\"]}\n",

Our analyses demonstrate that, in addition to Varroa destructor, the presence of the trypanosomatid parasite Crithidia mellificae and the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae in summer are also predictive markers of winter mortality, with a negative synergy being observed between the two in terms of their effects on colony mortality. Furthermore, we document the first occurrence of a parasitizing phorid fly in Europe, identify a new fourth strain of Lake Sinai Virus (LSV), and confirm the presence of other little reported pathogens such as Apicystis bombi, Aphid Lethal Paralysis Virus (ALPV), Spiroplasma apis, Spiroplasma melliferum and Varroa destructor Macula-like Virus (VdMLV). Finally, we provide evidence that ALPV and VdMLV replicate in honey bees and show that viruses of the LSV complex and Black Queen Cell Virus tend to non-randomly co-occur together.

As bees and flies differ markedly in their life history characteristics and resource needs, they may be active and hence provide pollination services at different times of the day. Here, we explore the differences in bee and fly diurnal activity patterns and how this may impact upon pollination services provided to Brassica rapa, a mass-flowering crop. We observed pollinators at two-hourly intervals from 6:00 to 20:00h in twelve fields in New Zealand in 2004–2005. Overall, bees were most active in the middle of the day and were more effective pollinators than flies, driven primarily by the high pollinator efficiency of Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris. Some fly taxa however, visited flowers early and late in the day when there were few bees. The results of this study demonstrate that fine-scale temporal dynamics and the spatial distribution of crop pollinators may directly affect the quantity of pollination services. The maintenance of biodiversity in agro-ecosystems may therefore be critical to ensure pollinator taxa are available under a range of environmental conditions.\\nEs ist bekannt, dass Bienen für eine große Anzahl von Feldfrüchten eine Bestäubungsfunktion wahrnehmen. Fliegen werden jedoch selten in den Abschätzungen dieser Funktion einbezogen. Da sich Bienen und Fliegen deutlich in ihren ökologischen Merkmalen und Ressourcenansprüchen unterscheiden, könnten sie zu verschiedenen Tageszeiten aktiv sein und demnach auch ihre Bestäubungsfunktion zu verschiedenen Tageszeiten ausüben. Wir vergleichen hier die diurnalen Aktivitätsmuster von Bienen und Fliegen und den Einfluss, den diese auf die Bestäubungsfunktion bei der vielblütigen Feldfrucht Brassica napa haben. Wir beobachteten die Bestäuber in zweistündigen Intervallen von 6.00 bis 20:00 Uhr auf zwölf Feldern in Neuseeland im Zeitraum 2004-2005.\\nInsgesamt waren die Bienen besonders in der Tagesmitte aktiv und sie waren die effektiveren Bestäuber im Vergleich zu den Fliegen, vor allem aufgrund der hohen Effizienz von Apis mellifera und Bombus terrestris. Einige Fliegentaxa besuchten jedoch die Blüten früh und spät am Tag, wenn es wenige Bienen gab. Das Ergebnis dieser Untersuchung demonstriert, dass die Dynamiken auf feinen Zeitskalen und die räumliche Verteilung der Feldfruchtbestäuber einen direkten Einfluss auf die Quantität der Bestäuberfunktion haben können. Die Erhaltung der Biodiversität in Agrarökosystemen kann demnach eine große Bedeutung in Agrarökosystemen haben, da sie dafür sorgt, dass die Bestäubertaxa über einen weiten Bereich der Umweltbedingungen zur Verfügung stehen.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1439-1791\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.baae.2012.10.011\"]}\n",

Whether queens or workers control the timing of these events is poorly understood. In the bumble-bee Bombus terrestris, queens exhibit a ‘switch point’ in which they switch from laying diploid eggs yielding females (workers and new queens) to laying haploid eggs yielding males. By rearing foundress queens whose worker offspring were removed as pupae and sexing their eggs using microsatellite genotyping, we found that queens kept in the complete absence of adult workers still exhibit a switch point. Moreover, the timing of their switch points relative to the start of egg-laying did not differ significantly from that of queens allowed to produce normal colonies. The finding that bumble-bee queens can express the switch point in the absence of workers experimentally demonstrates queen control of a key life-history event in eusocial insects.

Despite label precautions not to apply them to blooming plants, neonicotinoids and other residual systemic insecticides may be applied for preventive control of lawn insect pests when spring-flowering weeds are present. Dietary exposure to neonicotinoids adversely affects bees, but the extent of hazard from field usage is controversial. We exposed colonies of the bumble bee Bombus impatiens to turf with blooming white clover that had been treated with clothianidin, a neonicotinoid, or with chlorantraniliprole, the first anthranilic diamide labeled for use on lawns. The sprays were applied at label rate and lightly irrigated. After residues had dried, colonies were confined to forage for six days, and then moved to a non-treated rural site to openly forage and develop. Colonies exposed to clothianidin-treated weedy turf had delayed weight gain and produced no new queens whereas those exposed to chlorantraniliprole-treated plots developed normally compared with controls. Neither bumble bees nor honey bees avoided foraging on treated white clover in open plots. Nectar from clover blooms directly contaminated by spray residues contained 171±44 ppb clothianidin. Notably, neither insecticide adversely impacted bee colonies confined on the treated turf after it had been mown to remove clover blooms present at the time of treatment, and new blooms had formed. Our results validate EPA label precautionary statements not to apply neonicotinoids to blooming nectar-producing plants if bees may visit the treatment area. Whatever systemic hazard through lawn weeds they may pose appears transitory, however, and direct hazard can be mitigated by adhering to label precautions, or if blooms inadvertently are contaminated, by mowing to remove them. Chlorantraniliprole usage on lawns appears non-hazardous to bumble bees.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0066375\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"PMID: 23776667\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are important crop pollinators around the world and at least 10 species of phoretic mites have been associated with various bumble bee species.\\nHere, we investigated changes in the abundance of the introduced European B. terrestris across forest‐grassland edges in the Southern Alps of New Zealand, and concomitant changes in the phoretic mite loads on these mobile pollinators.\\nBumble bees penetrated up to 250 m inside forest fragments, with abundance declining with distance from the anthropogenic matrix habitat.

In behavioural experiments, we simulated varying pigment concentrations and studied its impact on the colour choices of bumblebees and honeybees. Individual bees were trained to artificial flowers having a specific concentration of a pigment, i.e. Acridine Orange or Aniline Blue, and then given the simultaneous choice between three test colours including the training colour, one colour of lower and one colour of higher pigment concentration. For each pigment, two set-ups were provided, covering the range of low to middle and the range of middle to high pigment concentrations. Despite the small bee-subjective perceptual contrasts between the tested stimuli and regardless of training towards medium concentrations, bees preferred neither the training stimuli nor the stimuli offering the highest pigment concentration but more often chose those stimuli offering the highest spectral purity and the highest chromatic contrast against the background. Overall, this study suggests that bees choose an intermediate pigment concentration due to its optimal conspicuousness. It is concluded that the spontaneous preferences of bees for flower colours of high spectral purity might exert selective pressure on the evolution of floral colours and of flower pigmentation.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0028-1042\", \"EISSN: 1432-1904\", \"PMID: 23722560\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s00114-013-1060-3\"]}\n",

Bumble bees spend a significant amount of time foraging on a wide variety of flowering plants, and this activity exposes them to both plant toxins and pesticides, posing a threat to individual and colony survival. Little is known about what detoxification pathways are active in bumble bees, how the expression of detoxification genes changes across life stages, or how the number of detoxification genes expressed in B. huntii compares to other insects.\\nWe found B. huntii expressed at least 584 genes associated with detoxification and stress responses. The expression levels of some of these genes, such as those encoding the cytochrome P450s, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and glycosidases, vary among different life stages to a greater extent than do other genes. We also found that the number of P450s, GSTs and esterase genes expressed by B. huntii is similar to the number of these genes found in the genomes of other bees, namely Bombus terrestris, Bombus impatiens, Apis mellifera and Megachile rotundata, but many fewer than are found in the fly Drosophila melanogaster.\\nBombus huntii has transcripts for a large number of detoxification and stress related proteins, including oxidation and reduction enzymes, conjugation enzymes, hydrolytic enzymes, ABC transporters, cadherins, and heat shock proteins. The diversity of genes expressed within some detoxification pathways varies among the life stages and castes, and we typically identified more genes in the adult females than in larvae, pupae, or adult males, for most pathways. Meanwhile, we found the numbers of detoxification and stress genes expressed by B. huntii to be more similar to other bees than to the fruit fly. The low number of detoxification genes, first noted in the honey bee, appears to be a common phenomenon among bees, and perhaps results from their symbiotic relationship with plants. Many flowering plants benefit from pollinators, and thus offer these insects rewards (such as nectar) rather than defensive plant toxins.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1471-2164\", \"EISSN: 1471-2164\", \"PMID: 24330608\", \"DOI: 10.1186/1471-2164-14-874\"]}\n",

To evaluate the community‐wide effects of interactions among flower visitors, I have examined changes in the flower utilization patterns of each visitor species at several sites where the component of the visitor's community differed. Specifically, I compared the flower preferences and foraging habits (legitimate foraging vs. primary nectar robbing vs. secondary nectar robbing) of five bumble bee species in flower patches consisting of Trifolium pratense L. (red clover) and T. repens L. (white clover) on Hokkaido Island, Japan. I also examined the nectar production and standing crops of each flower species to evaluate the exploitation competition based on nectar. The bumble bee species exhibited different flower utilization patterns among sites. At sites where the long‐tongued Bombus diversus tersatus was common and the exotic short‐tongued B. terrestris was rare, B. diversus tersatus visited red clover (long‐tubed flowers) exclusively, whereas medium‐tongued B. pseudobaicalensis and short‐tongued B. hypocrita sapporoensis and B. hypnorum koropokkrus preferentially visited white clover (short‐tubed flowers). Conversely, at sites where the long‐tongued bee was rare, four other species frequently visited red clover in different modes: B. pseudobaicalensis visited legitimately, B. hypocrita sapporoensis and B. terrestris visited as primary nectar robbers, and B. hypnorum koropokkrus visited as a secondary nectar robber. The presence or absence of resource exploitation by the long‐tongued species and the interaction between primary and secondary nectar robbers via robbing holes was the major ecological sources of these differences. Diverse effects of interactions among flower visitors played important roles in shaping pattern of plant and flower visitor interactions.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0912-3814\", \"EISSN: 1440-1703\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s11284-013-1051-z\", \"CODEN: ECRSEX\"]}\n",

The discovery of worker reproduction in foreign colonies challenges this view and suggests that workers' potential to pursue selfish interests may be higher than previously believed. However, whether such reproductive behaviour truly relies on a reproductive decision is still unknown. Workers' reproductive decisions thus need to be investigated to assess the extent of workers' reproductive options. Here, we show in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris that drifting is a distinct strategy by which fertile workers circumvent competition in their nest and reproduce in foreign colonies. By monitoring workers' movements between colonies, we show that drifting is a remarkably dynamic behaviour, widely expressed by both fertile and infertile workers. We demonstrate that a high fertility is, however, central in determining the propensity of workers to enter foreign colonies as well as their subsequent reproduction in host colonies. Moreover, our study shows that the drifting of fertile workers reflects complex decision-making processes associated with in-nest reproductive competition. This novel finding therefore adds to our modern conception of cooperation by showing the previously overlooked importance of alternative strategies which enable workers to assert their reproductive interests.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0962-8452\", \"EISSN: 1471-2954\"]}\n",

Violations of this independence assumption could produce artificial dissociations. Evidence for independence has been reported in humans, but similar tests have not been conducted with monkeys until now. In a within-subjects design using a matching-to-sample task, we manipulated one-trial memory strength and habit strength simultaneously. Memory delay intervals and encoding conditions affected one-trial memory scores without affecting habit scores. In contrast, biased reinforcement selectively changed habit scores but not one-trial memory scores. This behavioral double dissociation clearly shows that one-trial memory and habit can be manipulated independently, validating PDP as a valuable tool for cross-species studies of learning and memory and reinforcing the view that one-trial memory and habits are served by distinct brain systems.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1939-2087\", \"ISSN: 0735-7036\", \"DOI: 10.1037/a0030496\", \"PMID: 23106803\"]}\n",

The ground and plants conductively linked to it are negatively charged (Bowker and Crenshaw, 2007), whereas animals build up positive charge as they move in contact with air molecules (Jackson and McGonigle, 2005). Electric fields emanating from plants and pollinators, such as bees, are believed to promote pollination by enabling pollen grains to \\\" jump \\\" from flowers to pol-linators and vice versa (Corbet et al., 1982). Two recent studies reveal that bees not only detect these electric fields but also learn to discriminate them, indicating that electroreception should be seriously considered alongside vision and olfaction when studying bee behavior and ecology. Writing in Science, Clarke et al. (2013) demonstrated that bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) detect electric fields around plants and learn to use them to decide whether or not to visit flowers. Using a Faraday pail to measure electric fields generated by bees and plants, the team described how a bee visit temporarily modifies the electric charge of (Petunia) flowers, suggesting that floral electric properties could be used by future visitors to assess the reward value without necessarily needing to probe the flower. To explore this possibility, the authors used differential conditioning in which bees were trained to associate an electrically charged feeder (30 V) with a sucrose reward (CS+) and an uncharged feeder with an aversive quinine solution (CS−). After extensive training (50 trials), bees chose the rewarding feeder in around 80% of trials. Similar levels of performance were observed when bees were trained with two feeders carrying the same charge but different electric field patterns (homogeneous vs. bull's eye shape), indicating that these insects can learn both the magnitude and geometry of an electric field. Bees learned to perform even better in discrimination tasks if the two feeders differed both in color (shade of green) and their electric field pattern compared to if they differed only in color. Natural electric fields around flowers may therefore contribute to the multimodal sources of information that bees use to learn and memorize floral rewards, in conjunction with color, pattern, shape, texture,\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1664-1078\", \"DOI: 10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00445\"]}\n",

We used mass-flowering oilseed rape fields as locations to sample bees of this complex, as well as the second most common visitor to oilseed rape B. lapidarius, and molecular RFLP methods to distinguish between the cryptic species. We then used microsatellite genotyping to identify sisters and estimate colony densities, and related both proportions of cryptic species and their colony densities to the composition of the landscape surrounding the fields. We found B. lucorum was the most common member of the complex present in oilseed rape followed by B. terrestris. B. cryptarum was also present in all but one site, with higher proportions found in the east of the study area. High numbers of bumblebee colonies were estimated to be using oilseed rape fields as a forage resource, with B. terrestris colony numbers higher than previous estimates from non-mass-flowering fields. We also found that the cryptic species responded differently to surrounding landscape composition: both relative proportions of B. cryptarum in samples and colony densities of B. lucorum were negatively associated with the amount of arable land in the landscape, while proportions and colony densities of other species did not respond to landscape variables at the scale measured. This suggests that the cryptic species have different ecological requirements (which may be scale-dependent) and that oilseed rape can be an important forage resource for many colonies of bumblebees.

Aggression and egg-laying were more likely to co-occur in pairs placed without brood compared to pairs placed with brood. A significant positive correlation was found between members of a pair in the rates of aggression. In addition, a strong positive correlation was found in their rates of egg-laying: bees that had more sons also tended to have more nephews. The results show that under conditions of unrestricted food availability, behavioural interactions are compatible with continued reproduction by both orphaned workers.

Host–parasite interactions are complex, even in insects, and there can be heterogeneous outcomes in infection success, load, virulence and transmission, with consequences for the evolution of hosts and their parasites, and also for epidemiology. A comprehension that the triad of host, parasite and environment interact to dictate infection outcome is key for anyone interested in host–parasite research. Studies in model systems used to good effect to characterize insect immunity and infection rarely scrutinize such heterogeneity. Evolutionary ecology studies addressing natural variation offer a window on the causes and consequences of such heterogeneity. A system at the forefront in this area is that of bumblebees and their trypanosome parasite Crithidia. Placing results and interpretations in a broader context we synthesize the plethora of work on bumblebee immunity and parasite interactions. We describe and discuss the sources of heterogeneity that should also be considered in human‐relevant insect–parasite systems, including genotypic variation in both parasites and hosts, the mediating role of the environment, and explore the emerging evidence for microbiota modulating defence against parasites.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1365-3024\", \"DOI: 10.1111/pim.12043\", \"ISSN: 0141-9838\", \"PMID: 23758554\"]}\n",

Our findings demonstrate that native bee foraging is far more plastic and extensive than previously believed and does not follow a simple optimal foraging strategy. Rather, bumble bees forage further in pursuit of species-rich floral patches and in landscapes where patch-to-patch variation in floral resources is less, regardless of habitat composition. Thus, our results reveal extreme foraging plasticity and demonstrate that floral diversity, not density, drives bee foraging distance. Furthermore, we find a negative impact of paved habitat and a positive impact of natural woodland on bumble bee nesting densities.

Most importantly, we reveal significant relationships between pairwise FST and resistance models created from contemporary land use maps. Specifically, B. vosnesenskii gene flow is most limited by commercial, industrial and transportation‐related impervious cover. Finally, our fine‐scale analysis reveals significant but declining relatedness between individuals at the 1–9 km spatial scale, most likely due to local queen dispersal.

Many current theoretical models focus on the effect of floral resources' density on the net outcome of these indirect plant-plant interactions, often neglecting the identity of plant species in the communities and especially the species' spatial pattern. To fill this gap, we created a spatially explicit model whose goal was to study the interplay between relative densities and spatial distribution patterns of two plant species differing in their attractiveness for pollinators. Since theory predicts that pollinator behaviour strongly governs the outcome of pollination, we allowed the pollinators to systematically change their plant preferences based on their foraging experience. Thus the interplay between density and spatial patterns of plants was tested over a continuum of behaviours from specialists to generalists. Our most striking finding was that reproductive success of the less attractive species was affected in an opposite way by spatial patterns depending on whether the species had relatively low or high densities. Namely, when the less attractive species was highly abundant, its survival was higher when aggregated in large monospecific patches than when uniformly distributed. On the other hand, when the attractive species was more abundant, the less attractive species survived better when uniformly distributed. These results were consistent as long as the scale of the plant spatial aggregation was similar to or larger than the pollinators' detection range. Our results suggest that aggregated plant spatial patterns manipulate pollinator behaviour by trapping them within monospecific patches. This effect was sufficiently strong to enhance the survival of a competitively inferior species and hence to act in a way similar to the more familiar niche or temporal separation among plant species.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0030-1299\", \"EISSN: 1600-0706\", \"DOI: 10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.20801.x\", \"CODEN: OIKSAA\"]}\n",

One of the least understood of these is generalized food deception, in which flowers exploit non‐specific food‐seeking responses in their pollinators. Available evidence suggests that colour signals, scent and phenology may all play key roles in this form of deception. Here we investigate the pollination systems of five Eulophia spp. (Orchidaceae) lacking floral rewards. These species are pollinated by bees, notably Xylocopa (Anthophorinae, Apidae) or Megachile (Megachilidae) for the large‐flowered species and anthophorid (Anthophorinae, Apidae) or halictid (Halictidae) bees for the small‐flowered species. Spectra of the lateral petals and ultraviolet‐absorbing patches on the labella are strongly contrasting in a bee visual system, which may falsely signal the presence of pollen to bees. All five species possess pollinarium‐bending mechanisms that are likely to limit pollinator‐mediated self‐pollination. Flowering times extend over 3–4 months and the onset of flowering was not associated with the emergence of pollinators, some of which fly year round. Despite sharing pollinators with other plants and lacking rewards that would encourage fidelity, the Eulophia spp. exhibited relatively high levels of pollen transfer efficiency compared with other rewarding and deceptive orchids. We conclude that the study species employ generalized food deception and exploit food‐seeking bees. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London,\\nBotanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 171, 713–729.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1095-8339\", \"ISSN: 0024-4074\", \"DOI: 10.1111/boj.12028\"]}\n",

Although Japan has quarantine systems to protect ecosystems, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and human health against alien species, economic globalization has resulted in an ever-increasing risk of invasion. Mite invasion is no exception. Alien species that impact natural ecosystems are regulated in Japan by the Invasive Alien Species Act. However, the law focuses only on visibly recognizable species, so that species too small to see, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and mites, are beyond the scope of this law. The Plant Protection Law has limited the introduction of alien pests, including mites, that are harmful to agricultural crops. Recently, the liberalization of global trade policies have increased pressure to loosen regulations on various pests, including spider mites. Infectious diseases and their causative species are quarantined under the Rabies Prevention Law, the Domestic Animal Infectious Diseases Control Law, and the Human Infectious Diseases Control Law, but these laws do not cover wildlife diseases. The most serious problem is that wild reptiles, which can be carriers of ticks and tick-borne diseases, can be freely introduced to Japan. These loopholes in Japan’s regulatory system have resulted in mite and tick invasions, which affect not only wildlife communities and human society but also endemism and biological diversity of natural mite populations.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s10493-012-9609-y\", \"ISSN: 0168-8162\", \"PMID: 23001476\", \"EISSN: 1572-9702\", \"CODEN: EAACEM\"]}\n",

Here we used a stated preference method for a priori evaluating the willingness of the population to pay for different control programs of a new invasive bee species in Israel, the dwarf honey bee, Apis florea. We evaluated possible economic impacts of A. florea using two model plant species expected to be adversely affected by its invasion due to decreased pollination. The plants have no market value but they add aesthetic value to the open landscape. Using a mixed logit model we found that the mean willingness to pay (WTP) differed between the model plants, and increased with the extent of plant loss.

We thus tested the honeybees’ ability to discriminate between two closed shapes considering either absolute or differential conditioning, and using eight stimuli differing in their spectral characteristics. Consistent with previous work, green contrast enabled reliable shape learning for both types of conditioning, but surprisingly, we found that bees trained with appetitive-aversive differential conditioning could additionally use colour and/or UV contrast to enable shape discrimination. Interestingly, we found that a high blue contrast initially interferes with bee shape learning, probably due to the bees innate preference for blue colours, but with increasing experience bees can learn a variety of spectral and/or colour cues to facilitate spatial learning.

We have contrasted immune responses in honey bees to two common eukaryotic endoparasites by establishing single and mixed-species infections using the long-associated parasite Crithidia mellificae and the emergent parasite Nosema ceranae. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to screen host immune gene expression at 9 time points post inoculation. Systemic responses in abdomens during early stages of parasite establishment revealed conserved receptor (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule, Dscam and nimrod C1, nimC1), signaling (MyD88 and Imd) and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) effector (Defensin 2) responses. Late, established infections were distinct with a refined 2 AMP response to C. mellificae that contrasted starkly with a 5 AMP response to N. ceranae. Mixed species infections induced a moderate 3 AMPs. Transcription in gut tissues highlighted important local roles for Dscam toward both parasites and Imd signaling toward N. ceranae. At both systemic and local levels Dscam, MyD88 and Imd transcription was consistently correlated based on clustering analysis. Significant gene suppression occurred in two cases from midgut to ileum tissue: Dscam was lowered during mixed infections compared to N. ceranae infections and both C. mellificae and mixed infections had reduced nimC1 transcription compared to uninfected controls. We show that honey bees rapidly mount complex immune responses to both Nosema and Crithidia that are dynamic over time and that mixed-species infections significantly alter local and systemic immune gene transcription.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1016/j.dci.2013.03.010\", \"ISSN: 0145-305X\", \"EISSN: 1879-0089\", \"PMID: 23529010\"]}\n",

Here we investigated whether these derived functions in workers have developed by an uncoupling of endocrine mechanisms in adult queens and workers, or whether parallels can be found between the roles of the two hormones in both castes. We looked at yolk protein metabolism as a process central to the physiology of both queens and workers, and at sperm storage as a feature of the queen alone. Queens of differing fertility status (virgin, virgin but CO2-treated, inseminated, freshly laying and 1–2years-old) were compared regarding vitellogenin (Vg), JH and ecdysteroid-titers in their hemolymph, as well as ovarian yolk protein and spermathecal gland composition. Our results showed that hormone titres were unrelated to the composition of spermathecal glands. JH-concentrations in the hemolymph were low in the groups of queens characterized by yolk uptake into the ovaries, and high in pre-vitellogenic queens or animals that were forced to interrupt egg-laying by caging. Ecdysteroid-concentrations were higher in untreated virgins than after insemination or during egg-laying. They were not affected by the caging of queens. These patterns of hormone changes were parallel to those known from worker bees. Together, these findings suggest a conserved role for JH as repressor of vitellogenin uptake into tissues, and for ecdysteroids in preparing tissues for this process. An involvement of the two hormones in the regulation of sperm storage seems unlikely. Our results add to the view that JH and ecdysteroids act similarly on the yolk protein metabolism of both castes of A. mellifera. This may imply that it was the biochemical versatility of Vg rather than that of hormonal regulatory circuits that allowed for the functional separation of the two castes.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0022-1910\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.jinsphys.2013.04.006\", \"EISSN: 1879-1611\", \"PMID: 23631954\"]}\n",

The dark-red, tubular flowers of these irises are nectarless but provide protective shelters (i.e. a non-nutritive form of reward) primarily to male solitary bees (Apidae, Eucerini) that pollinate the flowers while looking for a shelter. An earlier study on orchids suggested that species pollinated predominantly by male solitary bees produce significantly larger amounts and larger numbers of different n-alkenes (unsaturated cuticular hydrocarbons). Whether or not this also applies to the Oncocyclus irises and whether pollinators are attracted by specific colours or scents of these flowers is unknown.MethodsUsing Iris atropurpurea, recording of pollinator preferences for shelters with different spatial parameters was combined with analyses of floral colours (by spectrophotometry) and scents (by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry) to test the hypotheses that (a) pollinators significantly prefer floral tunnels facing the rising sun (floral heat-reward hypothesis), and that (b) flowers pollinated predominantly by male solitary bees produce significantly larger amounts and larger numbers of unsaturated cuticular hydrocarbons (n-alkenes) in their floral scent (preadaptation to sexual-deception hypothesis).Key ResultsMale bees do not significantly prefer shelters facing the rising sun or with the presence of high absolute/relative amounts and numbers of n-alkenes in the floral scent.ConclusionsThe results suggest that the flowers of I. atropurpurea probably evolved by pollinator-mediated selection acting primarily on floral colours to mimic large achromatic (‘bee-black’) protective shelters used preferentially by male solitary bees, and that pollinator visits are presumably not the result of an odour-based sexual stimulation or motivated by an increased morning floral heat reward in tunnels facing the rising sun.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1095-8290\", \"PMID: 23599249\", \"DOI: 10.1093/aob/mct081\", \"ISSN: 0305-7364\", \"EISSN: 1095-8290\"]}\n",

However, their dynamics in genome evolution is unclear, whereby they are thought to evolve neutrally. More available genome sequences along with dated phylogenies allowed for studying the evolution of these repetitive DNA elements along evolutionary time scales. This could be used to compare rates of genome evolution. We show that SSRs in insects can be retained for several hundred million years. Different types of microsatellites seem to be retained longer than others. By comparing Dipteran with Hymenopteran species, we found very similar patterns of SSR loss during their evolution, but both taxa differ profoundly in the rate. Relative to divergence time, Diptera lost SSRs twice as fast as Hymenoptera. The loss of SSRs on the Drosophila melanogaster X-chromosome was higher than on the other chromosomes. However, accounting for generation time, the Diptera show an 8.5-fold slower rate of SSR loss than the Hymenoptera, which, in contrast to previous studies, suggests a faster genome evolution in the latter. This shows that generation time differences can have a profound effect. A faster genome evolution in these insects could be facilitated by several factors very different to Diptera, which is discussed in light of our results on the haplodiploid D. melanogaster X-chromosome. Furthermore, large numbers of SSRs can be found to be in synteny and thus could be exploited as a tool to investigate genome structure and evolution.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 23292136\", \"EISSN: 1759-6653\", \"ISSN: 1759-6653\", \"DOI: 10.1093/gbe/evs133\"]}\n",

Concern about the consequent impact on bees makes it important to understand their resilience. In the laboratory, the authors therefore fed adult worker bees on dosed syrup (125 μg L−1 of imidacloprid, or 98 μg kg−1) either continuously or as a pulsed exposure and measured their behaviour (feeding and locomotory activity) and whole‐body residues.\\nRESULTS\\nOn dosed syrup, honey bees maintained much lower bodily levels of imidacloprid than bumblebees (<0.2 ng versus 2.4 ng of imidacloprid per bee). Dietary imidacloprid did not affect the behaviour of honey bees, but it reduced feeding and locomotory activity in bumblebees. After the pulsed exposure, bumblebees cleared bodily imidacloprid after 48 h and recovered behaviourally.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe differential behavioural resilience of the two species can be attributed to the observed differential in bodily residues. The ability of bumblebees to recover may be environmentally relevant in wild populations that face transitory exposures from the pulsed blooming of mass‐flowering crops. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1526-4998\", \"PMID: 23633150\", \"CODEN: PMSCFC\", \"DOI: 10.1002/ps.3569\", \"ISSN: 1526-498X\"]}\n",

The hypothesis that sibling care evolved from ancestral maternal care in primitively eusocial insects has been elaborated to involve heterochronic changes in gene expression. This elaboration leads to the prediction that workers in these species will show patterns of gene expression more similar to foundress queens, who express maternal care behaviour, than to established queens engaged solely in reproductive behaviour. We tested this idea in bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) using a microarray platform with approximately 4500 genes. Unlike the waspPolistes metricus, in which support for the above prediction has been obtained, we found that patterns of brain gene expression in foundress and queen bumblebees were more similar to each other than to workers. Comparisons of differentially expressed genes derived from this study and gene lists from microarray studies inPolistesand the honeybeeApis melliferayielded a shared set of genes involved in the regulation of related social behaviours across independent eusocial lineages. Together, these results suggest that multiple independent evolutions of eusociality in the insects might have involved different evolutionary routes, but nevertheless involved some similarities at the molecular level.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2013.2419\", \"ISSN: 1471-2954\", \"ISSN: 0962-8452\", \"EISSN: 1471-2954\", \"PMID: 24552837\"]}\n",

Bees were trained to differentiate between flowers that harboured predators and flowers that were predator free. When test subjects were subsequently presented solely with the previously predator-infested flower species, there was a significant preference to only land on flowers occupied by other feeding conspecifics. Yet, when safe flowers were made available to subjects previously entrained to discriminate safe from predator-occupied flowers, subjects ignored other bees and the social information potentially provided by them, demonstrating that attraction towards conspecifics is confined to dangerous situations.

Do individuals that are good at learning in one sensory modality also perform well in another (performance is correlated between modalities), or do individuals demonstrate specialisation in learning performance in one modality (trading-off performance between modalities)? We tested these hypotheses by examining the performance of 76 Bombus terrestris workers, from four colonies, in both an odour-and visual learning task. Olfactory learning was assessed using proboscis extension reflex (PER) conditioning and visual (colour) learning was examined using a well-established free-flying paradigm. Our results showed neither a correlation, nor a trade-off, in individual performance for learning tasks using different sensory modalities. However, there was considerable variation among workers within each colony in their performance in both learning tasks. This extent of interindividual variation in learning ability across sensory modalities could be adaptive for colonies dealing with changeable foraging conditions. There was also significant intercolony variation in final task performance level in the olfactory learning task, and both the strength and persistence of blue preference in the colour learning task. This is the first study to demonstrate variation in olfactory learning performance across multiple bumblebee colonies using PER conditioning, suggesting this is an effective paradigm for assessing associative olfactory learning performance both within and among colonies.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00265-014-1765-0\", \"EISSN: 1432-0762\", \"ISSN: 0340-5443\"]}\n",

In the bumble-bee Bombus terrestris, we found methylation differences between the genomes of queenless reproductive workers and queenless non-reproductive workers. In a follow up experiment, queenless workers whose genomes had experimentally altered methylation were more aggressive and more likely to develop ovaries compared with control queenless workers. This shows methylation is important in this highly plastic reproductive division of labour. Methylation is an epigenetic tag for genomic imprinting (GI).

In order to shed light on the evolution of JH signaling in bees we performed allatectomy and replacement therapies to manipulate JH levels in workers of the \\\"primitively eusocial\\\" bumblebee Bombus terrestris. Allatectomized worker bees showed remarkable reduction in ovarian development, egg laying, Vitellogenin and Krüppel homolog 1 fat body transcript levels, hemolymph Vitellogenin protein abundance, wax secretion, and egg-cell construction.

Allatectomy also affected the amount of ester component in Dufour's gland secretion, which is thought to convey a social signal relating to worker fertility. These findings provide a strong support for the hypothesis that in contrast to honey bees, JH is a gonadotropin in bumblebees and lend credence to the hypothesis that the evolution of advanced eusociality in honey bees was associated with major modifications in JH signaling.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 24959888\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0100650\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

They are infamous for their high mortality after injection in honeybees. These viruses have also been reported in non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators such as bumblebees, which got infected with IAPV when placed in the same greenhouse with IAPV infected honeybee hives. Here we orally infected Bombus terrestris workers with different doses of either IAPV or KBV viral particles. The success of the infection was established by analysis of the bumblebees after the impact studies: 50days after infection. Doses of 0.5×107 and 1×107 virus particles per bee were infectious over this period, for IAPV and KBV respectively, while a dose of 0.5×106 IAPV particles per bee was not infectious. The impact of virus infection was studied in micro-colonies consisting of 5 bumblebees, one of which becomes a pseudo-queen which proceeds to lay unfertilized (drone) eggs. The impact parameters studied were: the establishment of a laying pseudo-queen, the timing of egg-laying, the number of drones produced, the weight of these drones and worker mortality. In this setup KBV infection resulted in a significant slower colony startup and offspring production, while only the latter can be reported for IAPV. Neither virus increased worker mortality, at the oral doses used. We recommend further studies on how these viruses transmit between different pollinator species. It is also vital to understand how viral prevalence can affect wild bee populations because disturbance of the natural host-virus association may deteriorate the already critically endangered status of many bumblebee species.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1096-0805\", \"EISSN: 1096-0805\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.jip.2014.06.011\", \"PMID: 25004171\", \"CODEN: JIVPAZ\", \"ISSN: 0022-2011\"]}\n",

To evaluate associative learning abilities in bees under controlled environmental conditions, the proboscis extension response (PER) assay is a well-established method used in honeybees and has recently been successfully adapted to bumblebees. In this study, we examined the cognitive abilities of workers of the eusocial bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, by training individuals in different olfactory learning tasks using classical PER conditioning. We compared learning performance for four different floral odors. Individuals were able to solve absolute (A+) and differential (A+ vs. B−) conditioning tasks, and no differences were found between single odors and odor combinations, respectively.

Our results indicate that workers of B. terrestris possess elemental olfactory learning abilities, but, in contrast to previous findings in honeybees, fail in more complex tasks, such as negative pattern discrimination.

The hypothesis that sibling care evolved from ancestral maternal care in primitively eusocial insects has been elaborated to involve heterochronic changes in gene expression. This elaboration leads to the prediction that workers in these species will show patterns of gene expression more similar to foundress queens, who express maternal care behaviour, than to established queens engaged solely in reproductive behaviour. We tested this idea in bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) using a microarray platform with approximately 4500 genes. Unlike the wasp Polistes metricus, in which support for the above prediction has been obtained, we found that patterns of brain gene expression in foundress and queen bumblebees were more similar to each other than to workers. Comparisons of differentially expressed genes derived from this study and gene lists from microarray studies in Polistes and the honeybee Apis mellifera yielded a shared set of genes involved in the regulation of related social behaviours across independent eusocial lineages. Together, these results suggest that multiple independent evolutions of eusociality in the insects might have involved different evolutionary routes, but nevertheless involved some similarities at the molecular level.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0962-8452\"]}\n",

As immune responses are costly, resource limitation should negatively affect immunity through trade-offs with other physiological requirements. Consequently, nutritional limitation should diminish immune capacity in general, but does it also dampen differences among hosts? We investigated the effect of short-term pollen deprivation on the immune responses of our model host Bombus terrestris when infected with the highly prevalent natural parasite Crithidia bombi. Bumblebees deprived of pollen, their protein source, show reduced immune responses to infection. They failed to upregulate a number of genes, including antimicrobial peptides, in response to infection. In particular, they also showed less specific immune expression patterns across individuals and colonies. These findings provide evidence for how immune responses on the individual-level vary with important elements of the environment and illustrate how nutrition can functionally alter not only general resistance, but also alter the pattern of specific host–parasite interactions.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2014.0128\", \"ISSN: 1471-2954\", \"EISSN: 1471-2945\", \"ISSN: 0962-8452\", \"PMID: 24850921\", \"EISSN: 1471-2954\"]}\n",

The secretion revealed a context-dependent composition with sterile females possessing large amounts of fatty acid dodecyl esters, ranging from dodecyl hexanoate to dodecyl oleate, compared to small amounts in fertile females. Significant reduction in the dodecyl esters also was found in queens at the competition phase, where worker reproduction, aggression, and gyne differentiation occur. The exclusive production of esters by sterile individuals also is typical of Dufour’s gland secretion in this species, albeit in this case these are octyl rather than dodecyl esters, and the differences between sterile and fertile individuals are qualitative rather than quantitative. We propose that the labial gland esters provide yet another signal of reproductive inactivity. In virgin queens, it may signal that egg laying is deferred to the next season, while in workers it reinforces the message “I am sterile and out of the reproductive competition”.

In this study we investigate the potential relationship between foraging ‘errors’ and foraging success among bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) workers. Individual foragers were trained to choose yellow, rewarded flowers and ignore blue, unrewarded flowers. We recorded the number of errors (visits to unrewarded flowers) each bee made during training, then tested them to determine how quickly they discovered a more profitable food source (either familiar blue flowers, or novel green flowers). We found that error prone bees discovered the novel food source significantly faster than accurate bees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time taken to discover the novel, more profitable, food source is positively correlated with foraging success. These results suggest that foraging errors are part of an ‘exploration’ foraging strategy, which could be advantageous in changeable foraging environments.

While in many insect species, including bumble bees, JH functions as gonadotropin in adults, in some highly eusocial insects its role has shifted to regulate social behavior including division of labor, dominance and aggression. Studying JH functions across social insect species is important for understanding the evolution of sociality; however, these studies have been limited due to inability to reduce JH levels without surgically removing its glandular source, the corpora allata. Precocene is known to inhibit JH biosynthesis in several non-social insects, but was poorly studied in social insects. Here, we tested if precocene-I can effectively reduce JH levels in Bombus terrestris workers, and examined its effects on their physiology and behavior. Precocene-I treatment of 3-worker groups decreased JH titer and ovarian activation, irrespective of the bees' dominance rank within the group, and was remedied by JH replacement therapy. Precocene-I also decreased aggressiveness and increased ester-sterility-signal production. These changes were rank-dependent, affected mainly in the most reproductive and the least aggressive workers, respectively, and could not be remedied by JH replacement therapy. These results clearly confirm the role of JH as a gonadotropin and mediator of aggression in B. terrestris, and that JH effects are associated with worker dominance rank. The ability to chemically reduce JH titer provides us with a non-intrusive method to probe the evolutionary changes associated with JH and the hormonal mechanisms that are associated with reproduction and behavior in social insects.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.107250\", \"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 1477-9145\", \"PMID: 25013106\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\"]}\n",

Although pesticide exposure has been implicated as a possible cause for bee declines, we currently have a limited understanding of the risk these chemicals pose. Whilst environmental exposure to pesticides typically has non‐lethal effects on individual bees, recent reports suggest that sublethal exposure can affect important behavioural traits such as foraging. However, at present, we know comparatively little about how natural foraging behaviour is impaired and the relative impacts of acute and chronic effects. Using Radio‐Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging technology, we examined how the day‐to‐day foraging patterns of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were affected when exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and/or a pyrethroid (λ‐cyhalothrin) independently and in combination over a four‐week period. This is the first study to provide data on the impacts of combined and individual pesticide exposure on the temporal dynamics of foraging behaviour in the field over a prolonged period of time. Our results show that neonicotinoid exposure has both acute and chronic effects on overall foraging activity. Whilst foragers from control colonies improved their pollen foraging performance as they gained experience, the performance of bees exposed to imidacloprid became worse: chronic behavioural impairment. We also found evidence, suggesting that pesticide exposure can change forager preferences for the flower types from which they collect pollen. Our findings highlight the importance of considering prolonged exposure (which happens in the field) when assessing the risk that pesticides pose to bees.

Seventeen variants were tested in 4 experiments. The best results were achieved with stuffed male cocoons but wool and polystyrene cocoons were also used. Although these cocoons were able to trigger continuous incubation behavior not even a monthly incubation of these imitations initiated oviposition. The fact that incubation does not lead to laying eggs is a somewhat surprising finding which has not been published yet. It also seems that the addition of a smell stimulus fails to reinforce stimulation if the tactile and olfactory stimuli are not concentrated into a single object. In the second part we surveyed whether the presence of a worker with prevented physical contact has the same stimulating effect on the neighboring queen as the presence of another queen. The presence of a worker without physical contact with the queen did not stimulate laying of eggs and moreover it was found that the presence of another queen has no stimulatory effect if the physical contact is prevented.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0030-9923\"]}\n",

Using as model organisms the bumblebee Bombus terrestris and its genetically highly variable trypanosomatid parasite Crithidia bombi we analysed the infection dynamics as well as the relative frequency of parasite recombinants over time, in colonies that were either immune-challenged with heat-killed bacteria or sham-inoculated. In addition, we used infective cells from a given colony to infect workers from other, untreated colonies, to investigate whether recombinant parasite strains may have a competitive advantage over the parental strains to infect the surrounding host population. We show that in our experimental setup the host immune status does not influence the proportion of recombinant parasite cells in the infection. Neither do recombinant parasite strains have an advantage over the parental ones at infecting workers unrelated to the host colony the infection originally came from. However, we found that the prevalence of recombinants was highly variable among colonies, with one particular colony producing significantly more recombinant strains than others.

In the bumble-bee Bombus terrestris, we found methylation differences between the genomes of queenless reproductive workers and queenless non-reproductive workers. In a follow up experiment, queenless workers whose genomes had experimentally altered methylation were more aggressive and more likely to develop ovaries compared with control queenless workers. This shows methylation is important in this highly plastic reproductive division of labour. Methylation is an epigenetic tag for genomic imprinting (GI).

This study investigates whether a generalist bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, can detect naturally occurring concentrations of nectar toxins. Using paired-choice experiments, we identified deterrence thresholds for five compounds found in the nectar of bee-pollinated plants: quinine, caffeine, nicotine, amygdalin and grayanotoxin. The deterrence threshold was determined when bumblebees significantly preferred a sucrose solution over a sucrose solution containing the compound. Bumblebees had the lowest deterrence threshold for the alkaloid quinine (0.01 mmol l(-1)); all other compounds had higher deterrence thresholds, above the natural concentration range in floral nectar. Our data, combined with previous work using honeybees, suggest that generalist bee species have poor acuity for the detection of nectar toxins. The fact that bees do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of these compounds likely indicates that it is difficult for them to learn to associate floral traits with the presence of toxins, thus maintaining this trait in plant populations.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 24526720\", \"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.097543\", \"ISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\"]}\n",

However, especially in the case of key wild pollinators, there are insufficient data on the relative impact of these individual environmental stressors and whether they interact to increase detrimental effects. Using a fully crossed factorial design, we investigated how laboratory exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides, thiamethoxam and clothianidin, over a 9‐week period and a prevalent trypanosome gut parasite Crithidia bombi affects various crucial colony traits of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We show that chronic dietary exposure from an early stage of colony development to doses of thiamethoxam and clothianidin that could be encountered in the field truncated worker production, reduced worker longevity and decreased overall colony reproductive success. Further, we demonstrate a significant interaction between neonicotinoid exposure and parasite infection on mother queen survival. The fate of the mother queen is intrinsically linked to colony success, and under combined pressure of parasite infection and neonicotinoid exposure, mother queen survival was lowest. This indicates increased detrimental effects of combined exposure on this crucial colony trait. Combined effects may be exacerbated in stressful natural environments where more pronounced parasite virulence is expected. Synthesis and applications. Our findings reiterate that dietary exposure to neonicotinoids can impact on bumblebee colony performance and fitness. The indication of combined negative effects of ecologically relevant pressures suggests additional adverse consequences for long‐term population dynamics under complex field conditions.

Nevertheless, the opposite relationship may arise if bees impair fruit or seed production and/or quality by damaging flowers during visitation, despite transferring pollen. We assessed pollination and drupelet set (i.e. the number of drupelets per fruit) in 16 raspberry Rubus idaeus fields along a gradient of bee abundance in north‐west Patagonia, Argentina. Using pollen supplementation, we also tested whether drupelet set was pollen limited in a subset of six fields. Managed Apis mellifera and the invasive bumblebee Bombus terrestris accounted for 50% and 45% of all bee visits, respectively, to raspberry flowers. Pollen loads on stigmas increased with visit frequency of all bees combined and particularly with visitation by A. mellifera, but not by B. terrestris. Drupelet set was not pollen limited along the gradient of bee abundance. Instead, drupelet set decreased with the proportion of damaged styles, which varied more strongly with the frequency of visits by B. terrestris than by A. mellifera. In fields with the highest bee frequency of visits (~300 visits flower⁻¹ day⁻¹), ~80% of styles were damaged in flowers and these developed into fruits with ~30% fewer drupelets compared to flowers in fields with the lowest bee visitation rates (~4 visits flower⁻¹ day⁻¹). Synthesis and applications. Extreme bee visitation, particularly by Bombus terrestris, damaged the styles of raspberry flowers, precluding ovule fertilization by deposited pollen and limiting crop production by reducing drupelet set. Only a few bee visits are required to maximize fruit production in raspberry plants, therefore, pollinator management in north‐west Patagonia should focus principally on reducing the abundance of the invasive bumblebee B. terrestris and secondarily controlling the number of honeybee hives in nearby cultivated fields. Although mainstream pollinator management relies on the assumption that more visits enhance fruit set, high bee visitation rates can be detrimental for fruit development and, consequently, for crop yield.\", \"identifier\": [\"CODEN: JAPEAI\", \"ISSN: 0021-8901\", \"DOI: 10.1111/1365-2664.12325\", \"EISSN: 1365-2664\"]}\n",

This study tested the hypothesis that bumblebees foraging in English urban gardens preferentially visited sympatric Palaearctic-range plants over species originating outside their native range.MethodsTwenty-seven surveys of flower availability and bumblebee visitation (Bombus spp.) were conducted over a 3-month summer period. Plants were categorized according to whether they were native British, Palaearctic or non-Palaearctic in origin. A phylogeny of the 119 plant species recorded was constructed and the relationship between floral abundance and the frequency of pollinator visits investigated by means of phylogenetically independent contrasts. Differentiation in utilization of plant species by the five bumblebee species encountered was investigated using niche overlap analyses.Key ResultsThere was conflicting evidence for preferential use of native-range Palaearctic plant species by bumblebees depending on which plants were included in the analysis. Evidence was also found for niche partitioning between species based on respective preferences for native and non-native biogeographical range plants. Two bumblebees (Bombus terrestris and B. pratorum) concentrated their foraging activity on non-Palaearctic plants, while two others (B. hortorum and B. pascourum) preferred Palaearctic species.ConclusionsThe long-running debate about the value of native and non-native garden plants to pollinators probably stems from a failure to properly consider biogeographical overlap between plant and pollinator ranges. Gardeners can encourage pollinators without consideration of plant origin or bias towards ‘local’ biogeographical species. However, dietary specialist bumblebees seem to prefer plants sympatric with their own biogeographical range and, in addition to the cultivation of these species in gardens, provision of native non-horticultural (‘weed’) species may also be important for pollinator conservation.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1095-8290\", \"PMID: 24647914\", \"ISSN: 0305-7364\", \"DOI: 10.1093/aob/mcu006\", \"EISSN: 1095-8290\"]}\n",

Consequently, nutritional limitation should diminish immune capacity in general, but does it also dampen differences among hosts? We investigated the effect of short-term pollen deprivation on the immune responses of our model host Bombus terrestns when infected with the highly prevalent natural parasite Crithidia bombi. Bumblebees deprived of pollen, their protein source, show reduced immune responses to infection. They failed to upregulate a number of genes, including antimicrobial peptides, in response to infection.

These host–parasite genotype-by-genotype (GH × GP) interactions influence evolutionary and ecological dynamics in important ways. Interactions can be produced through genetic variation; however, here, we assess the role of variable gene expression as an additional source of GH × GP interactions. The bumblebee Bombus terrestris and its trypanosome gut parasite Crithidia bombi are a model system for host–parasite matching. Full-transcriptome sequencing of the bumblebee host revealed that different parasite genotypes indeed induce fundamentally different host expression responses and host genotypes vary in their responses to the infecting parasite genotype. It appears that broadly and successfully infecting parasite genotypes lead to reduced host immune gene expression relative to unexposed bees but induce the expression of genes responsible for controlling gene expression. Contrastingly, a poorly infecting parasite genotype induced the expression of immunologically important genes, including antimicrobial peptides. A targeted expression assay confirmed the transcriptome results and also revealed strong host genotype effects. In all, the expression of a number of genes depends on the host genotype and the parasite genotype and the interaction between both host and parasite genotypes. These results suggest that alongside sequence variation in coding immunological genes, variation that controls immune gene expression can also produce patterns of host–parasite specificity.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1318628111\", \"ISSN: 1091-6490\", \"ISSN: 0027-8424\", \"PMID: 24550506\", \"EISSN: 1091-6490\"]}\n",

We developed an experimental set-up in which bumblebees simultaneously collected sugar solution and pollen from artificial flowers; natural pollen was mixed with cellulose powder or glass powder as a pollen surrogate. Here we show that bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) workers do not specialise in nectar or pollen collection, but regularly collect both rewards on the same day.

In the reciprocal tests, when offered a fixed sugar reward and varied amounts and concentrations of pollen mixed with a nutrient-free pollen surrogate, the bumblebees follow more an all-or-none rule for pollen, accepting all amounts and concentrations except pure surrogate.

This impact on males was not linked to preference as workers willingly fed lupanine-treated pollen to larvae, even though it was deleterious to colony health.

A number of recent studies suggest that nonspecific Pavlovian conditioning may explain some forms of social learning, so that animals simply learn to use the presence of conspecifics as a predictor of reward. In this study, we investigated the conditions of flower choice copying behaviour in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We raised bumblebees in controlled laboratory conditions to compare the social learning performance of bees with different previous associative experiences. We investigated the influence of foraging experience with conspecifics on transferring the preference for a socially indicated flower type to flowers of the same species not occupied by conspecifics. Observers that had the opportunity to associate conspecifics with rewarding flowers instantly acquired the social flower preference and equally visited occupied and unoccupied flowers of the socially indicated flower type (stimulus enhancement). Such usage of social cues requires prior experience with live conspecifics (bees familiarized only with inanimate model bees did not display the same generalization from socially indicated flowers to other flowers of the same type). By contrast, nonsocial cues and immobile model bees, even if they had been previously associated with rewarding flowers, resulted in a wholly different pattern of preference, where observers preferred only those individual flowers with the nonsocial cue or model bee attached (local enhancement). This difference suggests a special salience of live social cues as information providers and results in different patterns of associative learning than nonsocial cues.\\n•Bumblebees' flower preferences are influenced by conspecific choices.•We tested effects of live and model demonstrators and nonsocial cues.•Prior experience with live conspecifics induces stimulus enhancement.•Nonsocial cues led to a different flower preference than live social cues.•Model demonstrators and nonsocial cues result in local enhancement.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1095-8282\", \"ISSN: 0003-3472\", \"CODEN: ANBEA8\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.09.020\"]}\n",

Genetic analyses by polymorphic microsatellite loci suggest that the host population of B. terrestris is genetically diverse, as expected from a large invading founder population, and structured through isolation by distance. Genetically, the populations of the trypanosomatid parasite, Crithidia bombi, sampled in 2004 are less diverse, and distinct from the ones sampled later. Current C. bombi populations are highly heterozygous and also structured through isolation by distance correlating with the genetic distances of B. terrestris, suggesting the latter's expansion to be a main structuring factor for the parasite. 4.

We developed an experimental set-up in which bumblebees simultaneously collected sugar solution and pollen from artificial flowers; natural pollen was mixed with cellulose powder or glass powder as a pollen surrogate.

Modified host behaviour is considered an adaptive manipulation when it is induced by and provides a clear benefit to the parasite. Variability in the response of host organisms to parasitic manipulations can result in some hosts being more suitable than others if failure to induce a behaviour has fitness costs for the parasite. Individuals of the European bumblebee Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera, Apidae) that are parasitized by the endoparasitic larvae of a conopid fly (Conopidae, Diptera) bury themselves in soil just before death. This behaviour, which is of little consequence to the dying host, improves the survival and fitness of the parasitoid. In this study, we examined whether a parasitoid conopid fly, Physocephala tibialis, can successfully induce self-burial or ‘grave-digging’ behaviour in three bumblebee host species (B. bimaculatus, B. griseocollis and B. impatiens). Self-burial behaviour was expressed in all three host species, but at a far lower rate (17.4%) in B. griseocollis than in the other two species, which showed nearly equal rates of self-burial when parasitized (∼70%). Bombus impatiens and B. bimaculatus are more closely related to each other than to B. griseocollis, suggesting that genetic relatedness may influence host responsiveness to the parasitoid. We also found that larger hosts produced larger fly pupae, and that larger pupae generated bigger adult flies. In parasitoid literature, host suitability is often discussed in the context of receptiveness to oviposition and physiological resistance to infection. We posit that the ability to induce an important behavioural response influences host competency as well, and that host susceptibility to behavioural manipulation could have implications for selection.\\n•We examined whether a parasitoid fly induces burial behaviour in three bumblebee host species.•We provide the first report of this behavioural manipulation in North America.•We demonstrate that the parasitoid conopid fly cannot manipulate all hosts equally.•Rate of successful manipulation was equal in the two more closely related hosts.•Host body size positively influenced conopid fly pupal mass and adult size.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1095-8282\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.04.005\", \"ISSN: 0003-3472\", \"CODEN: ANBEA8\"]}\n",

To investigate whether environmentally realistic levels of thiamethoxam affect bumble bee performance over a realistic exposure period, we exposed queenless microcolonies of Bombus terrestris L. workers to a wide range of dosages up to 98μgkg−1 in dietary syrup for 17 days. Results showed that bumble bee workers survived fewer days when presented with syrup dosed at 98μg thiamethoxamkg−1, while production of brood (eggs and larvae) and consumption of syrup and pollen in microcolonies were significantly reduced by thiamethoxam only at the two highest concentrations (39, 98μgkg−1). In contrast, we found no detectable effect of thiamethoxam at levels typically found in the nectars of treated crops (between 1 and 11μgkg−1). By comparison with published data, we demonstrate that during an exposure to field-realistic concentrations lasting approximately two weeks, brood production in worker bumble bees is more sensitive to imidacloprid than thiamethoxam. We speculate that differential sensitivity arises because imidacloprid produces a stronger repression of feeding in bumble bees than thiamethoxam, which imposes a greater nutrient limitation on production of brood.\\n•Microcolonies of bumble bee workers were exposed to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam.•Workers survived fewer days when their diet contained thiamethoxam at 98μgkg−1.•Brood production and food consumption were reduced at concentrations ≥39μgkg−1.•Thiamethoxam at field-realistic levels had no detectable effect on bumble bees.•Bumble bees may be more sensitive to imidacloprid than thiamethoxam.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0147-6513\", \"PMID: 24238719\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.10.027\", \"CODEN: EESADV\", \"EISSN: 1090-2414\", \"ISSN: 1090-2414\"]}\n",

Although social information can provide an adaptive shortcut to new resources, recent theory predicts that investing too much time in acquiring new information can be detrimental. Here, we investigate whether foraging bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) strategically prioritize personal information unless there is evidence of environmental change. All bees in our study had personal information that one species of artificial flower was rewarding, and bees in the scent group then experienced social information about an alternative-scented species inside the nest, while a control group did not. On their next foraging bout, bees in both groups overwhelmingly used personal information when deciding where to forage. When bees subsequently learnt that the rewards offered by their preferred species had dwindled, bees that had social information were no quicker to abandon their personal information than control bees, but once they had sampled the alternative flowers, they showed greater commitment to that species than control bees. Thus, we found no evidence that social information is particularly important when personal information fails to produce rewards (a “copy when established behaviour is unproductive” strategy). Instead, bees used social information specifically to complement personal information.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00265-014-1725-8\", \"EISSN: 1432-0762\", \"ISSN: 0340-5443\"]}\n",

To understand these contrasting impacts, we review the benefits and costs associated with plant–pollinator interactions and enquire as to how the presence of abundant invaders affects the benefit–cost balance. We provide a conceptual framework that predicts that mutualism shifts to antagonism when invaders increase disproportionally in abundance relative to their interaction partners. This outcome is illustrated by an empirical example of a crop in which flower damage and an associated reduction in fruit quality represent interaction costs of intense visitation by invasive bees. More generally, the extremely high density of invasive flower visitors, such as <jats:styled-content style=\\\"fixed-case\\\">A</jats:styled-content>pis mellifera and <jats:styled-content style=\\\"fixed-case\\\">B</jats:styled-content>ombus terrestris, might have population‐ and community‐level consequences by hampering reproduction of native plants while promoting reproduction of alien plants. Furthermore, modification of the structure of pollination networks resulting from intense visitation of native plants by superabundant alien flower visitors in highly invaded communities could predict accentuated interaction costs for many native plants. Owing to their high density and the exclusion of native pollinators, invasive bees, originally introduced for honey production and crop pollination, may negatively impact both the native biota and agriculture.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0028-646X\", \"EISSN: 1469-8137\", \"ISSN: 1469-8137\", \"DOI: 10.1111/nph.12924\"]}\n",

In order to evaluate the impact of expanding anthropogenic landscapes on supporting pollinator potential, reliable tools are needed. Bombus terrestris is one of the most abundant bumblebee species in Europe, and these bumblebees are known as generalist pollinators of not only wild flowers in nature but also of crops in agriculture. For more than two decades, these bumblebees have been commercially mass reared for biological pollination in greenhouses. In this project, we placed commercial hives of the bumblebee B. terrestris containing one queen and 40 workers, in three different locations in the region of Ghent (Belgium), and the performance of these hives was followed during a 4-week period in spring 2012. In parallel, we determined the floral richness and diversity index in the chosen study sites. The sites consisted of a rich urban environment with patchy green areas opposed to an urban environment with poor landscape metrics; a third rural study site showed average positive landscape metrics. The results demonstrated that the hive biomass and numbers of workers increased significantly in the rich compared to the poor environment, providing a mechanism to discriminate between study sites. In addition, the bumblebee-collected pollen showed that the flowering plants Salix spp. and Rosaceae/Prunus spp. are dominant food sources in all anthropogenic environments during early spring.

We investigated the functional morphology of the compound eyes in 11 species of Bombus from various subgenera in detail. Of these, four species (Bombus confusus, Bombus melaleucus, Bombus mendax, Bombus niveatus) have enlarged male eyes, characterized by a higher number of ommatidia compared with worker eyes and a frontal zone with enlarged facets, which is likely to be associated with improved spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity. In these species, perching mating strategies are found. In contrast, males of species that patrol scent routes (Bombus hortorum, Bombus lapidarius, Bombus pascuorum, Bombus pratorum, Bombus soroeensis, Bombus terrestris, Bombus wurflenii) show no distinct eye adaptations, and their eye morphology closely resembles that of the workers.

The largest impact for both neonicotinyls starting at 20 (16 I, 17 C) ppb was the statistically significant reduction in queen survival (37% I, 56% C) ppb, worker movement, colony consumption, and colony weight compared to 0 ppb treatments. Bees at feeders flew back to the nest box so it appears that only a few workers were collecting syrup in the flight box and returning the syrup to the nest.

Neonicotinyl residues were lower in wax pots in the nest than in the sugar syrup that was provided.

Characteristic learning flights help acquiring these memories at newly discovered foraging locations where landmarks-salient objects in the vicinity of the goal location-can play an important role in guiding the animal's homing behavior. Although behavioral experiments have shown that bees can use a variety of visual cues to distinguish objects as landmarks, the question of how landmark features are encoded by the visual system is still open. Recently, it could be shown that motion cues are sufficient to allow bees localizing their goal using landmarks that can hardly be discriminated from the background texture. Here, we tested the hypothesis that motion sensitive neurons in the bee's visual pathway provide information about such landmarks during a learning flight and might, thus, play a role for goal localization. We tracked learning flights of free-flying bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) in an arena with distinct visual landmarks, reconstructed the visual input during these flights, and replayed ego-perspective movies to tethered bumblebees while recording the activity of direction-selective wide-field neurons in their optic lobe. By comparing neuronal responses during a typical learning flight and targeted modifications of landmark properties in this movie we demonstrate that these objects are indeed represented in the bee's visual motion pathway. We find that object-induced responses vary little with object texture, which is in agreement with behavioral evidence. These neurons thus convey information about landmark properties that are useful for view-based homing.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00335\", \"PMID: 25309374\", \"EISSN: 1662-5153\", \"ISSN: 1662-5153\"]}\n",

While oligolectic species forage on pollen from a single family of host plants, polylectic bees, such as bumblebees, collect pollen from many families of plants. These polylectic species contend with interspecific variability in essential nutrients of their host-plants but we have only a limited understanding of the way in which chemicals and chemical combinations influence bee development and feeding behaviour. In this paper, we investigated five different pollen diets (Calluna vulgaris, Cistus sp., Cytisus scoparius, Salix caprea and Sorbus aucuparia) to determine how their chemical content affected bumblebee colony development and pollen/syrup collection. Three compounds were used to characterise pollen content: polypeptides, amino acids and sterols. Several parameters were used to determine the impact of diet on micro-colonies: (i) Number and weight of larvae (total and mean weight of larvae), (ii) weight of pollen collected, (iii) pollen efficacy (total weight of larvae divided by weight of the pollen collected) and (iv) syrup collection. Our results show that pollen collection is similar regardless of chemical variation in pollen diet while syrup collection is variable. Micro-colonies fed on S. aucuparia and C. scoparius pollen produced larger larvae (i.e. better mates and winter survivors) and fed less on nectar compared to the other diets.

Flying animals primarily rely on optic flow to control flight speed and distance to obstacles. Here, we investigate whether swimming animals use similar strategies for self-motion control to flying animals by directly comparing the trajectories of zebrafish (Danio rerio) and bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) moving through the same experimental tunnel. While moving through the tunnel, black and white patterns produced (i) strong horizontal optic flow cues on both walls, (ii) weak horizontal optic flow cues on both walls and (iii) strong optic flow cues on one wall and weak optic flow cues on the other. We find that the mean speed of zebrafish does not depend on the amount of optic flow perceived from the walls. We further show that zebrafish, unlike bumblebees, move closer to the wall that provides the strongest visual feedback. This unexpected preference for strong optic flow cues may reflect an adaptation for self-motion control in water or in environments where visibility is limited.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1098/rsbl.2014.0279\", \"ISSN: 1744-957X\", \"PMID: 24872463\", \"ISSN: 1744-9561\", \"EISSN: 1744-957X\"]}\n",

One of them is their expression in tissues other than the hypopharyngeal glands (HGs), the site of royal jelly production. The sole MRJP-like gene of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris (BtRJPL), represents a pre-diversification stage of the MRJP gene evolution in bees. Here we investigate the expression of BtRJPL in the HGs and the brain of bumblebees. Comparison of the HGs of bumblebees and honeybees revealed striking differences in their morphology with respect to sex- and caste-specific appearance, number of cells per acinus, and filamentous actin (F-actin) rings. At the cellular level, we found a temporary F-actin-covered meshwork in the secretory cells, which suggests a role for actin in the biogenesis of the end apparatus in HGs. Using immunohistochemical localization, we show that BtRJPL is expressed in the bumblebee brain, predominantly in the Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies, the site of sensory integration in insects, and in the optic lobes. Our data suggest that a dual gland-brain function preceded the multiplication of MRJPs in the honeybee lineage.

For the more than 950 species of Salvia, only bee and bird pollinations are known. Restriction to these pollinators is mainly due to the specific flower construction (lever mechanism). Nevertheless, it has been repeatedly suggested that Salvia flowers might also be pollinated by flies. Are flies able to handle the lever mechanism? Are they functionally equivalent pollinators? In this study, we compared and quantified pollen transfer by bees and flies to test whether flies are true pollinators in Salvia.• Methods: We identified pollinators using field observations and photos. Video documentation of the visitation rate and the site of pollen placement on the pollinator body, morphometric measurements, quantification of pollen placement, pollen load, handling time, and stigma contact ratio were analyzed.• Key results: Field investigations revealed that 19 insect species pollinated S. virgata and four pollinated S. verticillata, including 16 bee species from seven genera of the Apidae and three fly species from three genera of the Nemestrinidae and Tabanidae.• Conclusions: Flies have been found to be pollinators in primarily bee-pollinated Salvia species. This result demonstrates the potential of a given “melittoid” flower construction to broaden the range of pollinators to guarantee successful pollination and seed production. Though bees, particularly Bombus terrestris, were more efficient than flies, the study shows that flies significantly contribute to pollen transfer in Salvia.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1537-2197\", \"ISSN: 1537-2197\", \"DOI: 10.3732/ajb.1400422\", \"ISSN: 0002-9122\", \"PMID: 25480711\", \"CODEN: AJBOAA\"]}\n",

We found that bumblebee colonies located at the site near the honeybee apiary gained less weight, and produced fewer and smaller queens, in both years than colonies at the site far from the apiary. The ratio of queen weight/size was lower in the colonies near honeybees in 1 year, while males were smaller and offspring sex ratio more male biased in colonies close to honeybees than in those far from honeybees.

A number of stressors have been identified as potential contributing factors, including the extensive prophylactic use of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are highly toxic to bees, in agriculture. While multiple routes of exposure to these systemic insecticides have been documented for honey bees, contamination from puddle water has not been investigated. In this study, we used a multi-residue method based on LC-MS/MS to analyze samples of puddle water taken in the field during the planting of treated corn and one month later. If honey bees were to collect and drink water from these puddles, our results showed that they would be exposed to various agricultural pesticides. All water samples collected from corn fields were contaminated with at least one neonicotinoid compound, although most contained more than one systemic insecticide. Concentrations of neonicotinoids were higher in early spring, indicating that emission and drifting of contaminated dust during sowing raises contamination levels of puddles. Although the overall average acute risk of drinking water from puddles was relatively low, concentrations of neonicotinoids ranged from 0.01 to 63 µg/L and were sufficient to potentially elicit a wide array of sublethal effects in individuals and colony alike. Our results also suggest that risk assessment of honey bee water resources underestimates the foragers' exposure and consequently miscalculates the risk. In fact, our data shows that honey bees and native pollinators are facing unprecedented cumulative exposure to these insecticides from combined residues in pollen, nectar and water. These findings not only document the impact of this route of exposure for honey bees, they also have implications for the cultivation of a wide variety of crops for which the extensive use of neonicotinoids is currently promoted.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0108443\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"PMID: 25438051\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

In some of these species (including some termites, ants, and the honey bee), juvenile hormone and vitellogenin levels are negatively correlated and juvenile hormone has shifted its role from a gonadotropin to a regulator of maturation and division of labor in the primarily sterile workers. The function of vitellogenin also seems to have broadened to encompass similar roles. Thus, the functions and molecular interactions of juvenile hormone and vitellogenin are hypothesized to have undergone changes during the evolution of eusociality, but the mechanisms underlying these changes are unknown.Bumble bees offer an excellent model system for testing how the relationship between juvenile hormone and vitellogenin evolved from solitary to social species. Bumble bee colonies are primitively eusocial and comprised of a single reproductive queen and facultatively sterile workers. In Bombus terrestris, juvenile hormone retains its ancestral role as a gonadotropin and is also hypothesized to regulate aggressive behavior. However, the function of vitellogenin and its interactions with juvenile hormone have not yet been characterized.\\nBy characterizing vitellogenin RNA expression levels (vg) in B. terrestris we show that vg is not associated with task and only partially associated with worker age, queen presence, and caste (queen vs worker). The correlations of vg with ovarian activation were not consistent across experiments, but both vg and ovarian activation were significantly associated with levels of aggression experienced by workers. Treatment with juvenile hormone did not affect vg levels in queenless groups.\\nWe suggest that social interactions affect vg levels more strongly than a worker's reproductive physiological state, and that juvenile hormone and vg are uncoupled in this species. Thus, although juvenile hormone maintains its traditional role as gonadotropin in B. terrestris, vg has already been co-opted into a novel role, consistent with the model that Bombus represents an intermediate stage in the evolution of eusociality.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 24618396\", \"EISSN: 1471-2148\", \"ISSN: 1471-2148\", \"DOI: 10.1186/1471-2148-14-45\"]}\n",

Size variations in pollinator populations may modify competitive interactions among foragers. Competition among pollinators has been shown to lead to one of two contrasting behaviours: either specialisation to the most profitable plant species or generalisation to several species. When foraging, pollinators are also confronted with heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of plant resources. Because variations in both the forager density and plant spatial distribution can affect pollinator behaviour, focus was on the interactive effect of these two factors. 2. Bumble bee (Bombus terrestris L.) individuals were trained on a focal species (Lotus corniculatus L.) and experimentally tested whether variations in the forager density (two or six bumble bees foraging together), plant community spatial distribution (two plant species: L. corniculatus and Medicago sativa, which were either patchily or randomly distributed), and their interaction modified bumble bee foraging behaviour. 3. It was shown that when confronted with a high forager density, bumble bees focused their visits towards the most familiar species, especially when foraging under a random plant distribution. These modifications affected the fruiting of the focal plant species, with a significantly lower reproductive success under low density/patchy conditions. 4. This study demonstrates that the foraging decisions of bumble bees are influenced by variations in both the conspecific density and plant spatial distribution. Given the increasing impact of human activities on plant‐pollinator communities, this raises the question of the potential implications of these results for plant communities in natural conditions when confronted with variations in the pollinator density and spatial distribution of plants.\", \"identifier\": [\"CODEN: EENTDT\", \"ISSN: 0307-6946\", \"DOI: 10.1111/een.12106\", \"EISSN: 1365-2311\"]}\n",

Dptra expression was assessed by qPCR and whole-mount in situ hybridization in different reproductive stages. The Dptra cDNA, 1652bp in length, has a 1158-bp open reading frame that encodes a 385 amino acid polypeptide containing one Sex determination protein N terminal (SDP_N) superfamily, eight putative phosphorylation sites, and an arginine–serine (RS)-rich domain at the N-terminus.

Phylogenetic analysis based on deduced amino acid sequences revealed that Dptra clustered in the hymenopteran clade and was most closely related to D. magna and A. mellifera. qPCR showed that Dptra expression increased significantly (P<0.05) in different reproductive stages in the following order: male, ephippial female, parthenogenetic female, resting egg and juvenile female. Dptra expression is significantly different between males and females and it is significantly greater in ephippial females and males than in parthenogenetic D. pulex (with summer eggs).

Here, we focus on the impacts of chronic exposure to the commonly used pyrethroid pesticide lambda (λ)-cyhalothrin on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris at both the individual and colony level. Furthermore, we investigated the interactions of pesticide exposure with a highly prevalent trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi. Colonies were exposed to λ-cyhalothrin in the laboratory, and colony growth and reproductive output were monitored for up to 14 weeks. The potential interactions between the pesticide and C. bombi were investigated by quantifying the impact of pesticide treatment on susceptibility to, and success of experimental infections, as well as the survival of workers. Male survival after larval pesticide exposure was also monitored. 3. Pesticide-treated colonies produced workers with a significantly lower body mass. However, out of the twelve variables of colony development measured, this was the only metric that was significantly affected by pesticide treatment and there was no subsequent significant impact on the reproductive output of colonies. 4.

The nectar-rewarding orchid Brachystele unilateralis and the nectarless and deceit-pollinated Chloraea virescens are restricted to the Southern Andes, where a single native and endemic bumblebee (Bombus dahlbomii) occured until the introduction of honeybees and highly invasive European bumblebees. Here, we describe the floral features, breeding system, pollinator activity and fruiting success of these orchid species. Both are self-compatible but pollinator-dependent, i.e., unable to set fruit and seed in the absence of pollinators. Field observations revealed that most of their current reproductive success is due to the introduced Bombus terrestris, Bombus ruderatus and Apis mellifera bees. The only native pollinator recorded was B. dahlbomii, but this bee was rarely observed due to its steady decline since the introduction of the alien Bombus species. The observed natural fruiting success per inflorescence in both studied species proved to be remarkably high by orchid standards: 83% and 66%, respectively. These results suggest that sexual reproduction in these orchids is not necessarily threatened by the decline of their native pollinator since pollination is successfully achieved by introduced bees. This provides a plausible better outlook for these and other regional, bumblebee-pollinated orchids and raises caution on eventual conservation policies involving the management of these introduced bee species.

They could either combine the available cues using a view-based computational mechanism or pick one cue. We tested these strategies by training honeybees, Apis mellifera carnica, and bumblebees, Bombus terrestris, to locate food in one of the four corners of a box-shaped flight arena, providing multiple and also ambiguous cues. In tests, bees confused the diagonally opposite corners, which looked the same from the inside of the box owing to its rectangular shape and because these corners carried the same local colour cues. These ‘rotational errors’ indicate that the bees did not use compass information inferred from the geomagnetic field under our experimental conditions. When we then swapped cues between corners, bees preferred corners that had local cues similar to the trained corner, even when the geometric relations were incorrect. Apparently, they relied on views, a finding that we corroborated by computer simulations in which we assumed that bees try to match a memorized view of the goal location with the current view when they return to the box. However, when extra visual cues outside the box were provided, bees were able to resolve the ambiguity and locate the correct corner. We show that this performance cannot be explained by view matching from inside the box. Indeed, the bees adapted their behaviour and actively acquired information by leaving the arena and flying towards the cues outside the box. From there they re-entered the arena at the correct corner, now ignoring local cues that previously dominated their choices. All individuals of both species came up with this new behavioural strategy for solving the problem provided by the local ambiguity within the box. Thus both species seemed to be solving the ambiguous task by using their route memory, which is always available during their natural foraging behaviour.\\n•We study how bees use multiple cues for visual homing.•Bees rely on views rather than on a separate geometric representation.•Bees adapt behaviour to acquire information actively when the task is ambiguous.•They solve the ambiguous task using information from their route memory.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1095-8282\", \"ISSN: 0003-3472\", \"CODEN: ANBEA8\", \"ISSN: 1095-8282\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.12.007\"]}\n",

Patterns of dispersal and gene flow are key determinants of species' ability to respond to land‐use change, but have been little investigated at a fine scale (<10 km) in bumble bees. Using microsatellite markers, we determined the fine‐scale spatial genetic structure of populations of four common Bombus species (B. terrestris, B. lapidarius, B. pascuorum and B. hortorum) and one declining species (B. ruderatus) in an agricultural landscape in Southern England, UK. The study landscape contained sown flower patches representing agri‐environment options for pollinators. We found that, as expected, the B. ruderatus population was characterized by relatively low heterozygosity, number of alleles and colony density. Across all species, inbreeding was absent or present but weak (FIS = 0.01–0.02). Using queen genotypes reconstructed from worker sibships and colony locations estimated from the positions of workers within these sibships, we found that significant isolation by distance was absent in B. lapidarius, B. hortorum and B. ruderatus. In B. terrestris and B. pascuorum, it was present but weak; for example, in these two species, expected relatedness of queens founding colonies 1 m apart was 0.02. These results show that bumble bee populations exhibit low levels of spatial genetic structure at fine spatial scales, most likely because of ongoing gene flow via widespread queen dispersal. In addition, the results demonstrate the potential for agri‐environment scheme conservation measures to facilitate fine‐scale gene flow by creating a more even distribution of suitable habitats across landscapes.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0962-1083\", \"EISSN: 1365-294X\", \"DOI: 10.1111/mec.12823\", \"PMID: 24980963\"]}\n",

Such social learning might be explained by relatively simple associative learning mechanism: the bee may learn to associate conspecifics with nectar or pollen reward through previous experience of foraging jointly. However, in some studies, observers were guided by choices of 'demonstrators' viewed through a screen, so no reward was given to the observers at the time of seeing other bees' flowers choice and no demonstrator bee was present at the moment of decision. This behaviour, referred to observational conditioning, implies an additional associative step as the positive value of conspecific is transferred to the associated flower. Here we explore the role of demonstrator movement, and the distance between observers and demonstrators that is required for observation conditioning to take place. We identify the conditions under which observational conditioning occurs in the widespread European species Bombus terrestris. The presence of artificial demonstrator bees leads to a significant change in individual colour preference toward the indicated colour if demonstrators were moving and observation distance was limited (15 cm), suggesting that observational conditioning could only influence relatively short-range foraging decisions. In addition, the movement of demonstrators is a crucial factor for observational conditioning, either due to the more life-like appearance of moving artificial bees or an enhanced detectability of moving demonstrators, and an increased efficiency at directing attention to the indicated flower colour. Bumblebees possess the capacity to learn the quality of a flower by distal observation of other foragers' choices. This confirms that social learning in bees involves more advanced processes than simple associative learning, and indicates that observational conditioning might be widespread in pollinating insects, raising intriguing questions for the underlying mechanisms as well as the spread of social information in pollinator-plant interactions.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0088415\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

By contrast to most insects in which JH is a gonadotropin regulating female fertility, in the highly eusocial honey bee (Apis mellifera) JH has lost its gonadotrophic function in adult females, and instead regulates age-related division of labor among worker bees. In order to shed light on the evolution of JH signaling in bees we performed allatectomy and replacement therapies to manipulate JH levels in workers of the \\\"primitively eusocial\\\" bumblebee Bombus terrestris. Allatectomized worker bees showed remarkable reduction in ovarian development, egg laying, Vitellogenin and Krüppel homolog 1 fat body transcript levels, hemolymph Vitellogenin protein abundance, wax secretion, and egg-cell construction. These effects were reverted, at least partially, by treating allatectomized bees with JH-III, the natural JH of bees. Allatectomy also affected the amount of ester component in Dufour's gland secretion, which is thought to convey a social signal relating to worker fertility. These findings provide a strong support for the hypothesis that in contrast to honey bees, JH is a gonadotropin in bumblebees and lend credence to the hypothesis that the evolution of advanced eusociality in honey bees was associated with major modifications in JH signaling.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0100650\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

A serial reversal task requires learning of an initial discrimination between two differentially rewarded stimuli, followed by multiple reversals of the reward contingency between stimuli. A reduction in errors with repeated reversals in a serial reversal task is an indicator of behavioural flexibility. Bees were housed in a large indoor environment and tested during foraging flights. Testing free-flying bees allowed for large numbers of trials and reversals. All bees were trained to perform a simultaneous discrimination between two colours for a nectar reward, followed by nine reversals of this discrimination. Results showed that bumblebees reduced errors and improved their performance across successive reversals. A reduction in perseverative errors was the major cause of the improvement in performance. Bees showed a slight increase in error rate in their final trials, perhaps as a consequence of increasing proactive interference, but proactive interference may also have contributed to the overall improvement in performance across reversals. Bumblebees are thus capable of behavioural flexibility comparable to that of other animals and may use proactive interference as a mechanism of behavioural flexibility in varying environments.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1435-9448\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s10071-013-0704-1\", \"EISSN: 1435-9456\", \"PMID: 24218120\"]}\n",

We investigated the roles of parasite communities, through enemy release and parasite acquisition, and genetic diversity in the invasion success of the non‐native bumblebee, Bombus hypnorum, in the United Kingdom. The invasive B. hypnorum had higher parasite prevalence than most, or all native congeners for two high‐impact parasites, probably due to higher susceptibility and parasite acquisition. Consequently parasites had a higher impact on B. hypnorum queens’ survival and colony‐founding success than on native species. Bombus hypnorum also had lower functional genetic diversity at the sex‐determining locus than native species. Higher parasite prevalence and lower genetic diversity have not prevented the rapid invasion of the United Kingdom by B. hypnorum.

Orphaned worker bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) with comparatively high or low levels of social activity were paired to determine whether aggression and reproduction could be traced to earlier social interactions. The workers were paired according to their levels of social activity (a socially active+another socially active worker, socially active+socially inactive, and two socially inactive workers). The presence or absence of brood was also manipulated. The absence of brood increased both aggression and ovarian development, suggesting that aggression and reproduction are associated or that there is a third variable that affects both. Socially active pairs were significantly more aggressive: here, social activity can be taken as an early indicator of aggression. No such effect, however, was obtained on ovarian development as the socially active pairs did not differ on their degree of ovarian development compared to the others. Within the socially active+socially inactive pairs, the socially active worker did not have more developed ovaries and was not more aggressive than her socially inactive partner. Results highlight that environmental conditions (the absence of brood) can predict ovarian development and although social activity can be observed prior to aggression, differences in aggression do not translate into differences in ovarian development under these conditions.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 24355525\", \"CODEN: BPRODA\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.beproc.2013.11.012\", \"EISSN: 1872-8308\", \"ISSN: 0376-6357\"]}\n",

However, workers in ant or bee colonies often vary in behaviour and morphology even when genetic variation is low. Bumblebees provide a unique opportunity to explore the consequences of such variation: colonies have a wide range of worker body sizes compared to other social bee species, and workers also vary in response thresholds (i.e. stimulus levels at which workers respond by performing a task), in spite of queens being singly mated (and thus, low genetic variation). Here we test how body size and response threshold diversity affect colony performance in two unrelated in-nest tasks (thermoregulation and undertaking). We manipulated worker diversity using worker removals to restrict threshold or body size variation within the colony. We also quantified the degree of intracolony variation across colonies and related this to colony performance. In general, colonies took longer to cool the nest after bees were removed, but there was no significant effect of treatment on fanning or undertaking success. Furthermore, when intracolony variation was analysed as a continuous variable, we found no effect on colony-level thermoregulation or undertaking performance. Instead, average threshold was a more useful predictor of thermoregulation success, and colonies with a narrower range of size variation had more success at undertaking. These results emphasize the importance of understanding how different types of variation (e.g. behavioural, morphological, etc.) contribute to colony performance.\\n•Body size and response thresholds of bumblebee workers vary considerably within a colony.•We tested how response threshold and body size variation affect two in-nest performance tasks in bumblebees.•Large variation in intracolony threshold or size did not affect thermoregulation or undertaking performance.•Average threshold was a more useful predictor of thermoregulation success.•Colonies with a narrow range of size variation had more success at undertaking.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1095-8282\", \"ISSN: 0003-3472\", \"CODEN: ANBEA8\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.10.017\"]}\n",

The mechanism behind reduced nest performance, however, remains unclear. Here we use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to test whether exposure to a low, field realistic dose (0.7 ppb in sugar water and 6 ppb in pollen) of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, reduces worker foraging efficiency. Whilst the nectar foraging efficiency of bees treated with imidacloprid was not significantly different than that of control bees, treated bees brought back pollen less often than control bees (40 % of trips vs 63 % trips, respectively) and, where pollen was collected, treated bees brought back 31 % less pollen per hour than controls. This study demonstrates that field-realistic doses of these pesticides substantially impacts on foraging ability of bumblebee workers when collecting pollen, and we suggest that this provides a causal mechanism behind reduced queen production in imidacloprid exposed colonies.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s10646-014-1189-7\", \"PMID: 24448674\", \"ISSN: 1573-3017\", \"EISSN: 1573-3017\", \"ISSN: 0963-9292\", \"CODEN: ECOTEL\"]}\n",

Individual bees with experimentally induced forewing wear (0%–24% forewing area loss, 0%–38% forewing area asymmetry) were harnessed with a string to which small bead groups were attached and tested in a flight chamber to measure the maximum weight that they could lift incrementally. Wing wear significantly decreased load-lifting ability: the higher the mean wing area loss, the less mass a bee could lift (2.66 mg load reduction per 1% forewing area loss, which represents ∼1.6% of mean body mass or ∼5.2% of expected mean nectar load). However, wing area asymmetry, both alone and in combination with area loss, had no detectable effect on maximum lift. The clear cost of wing wear for bumble bees is a linear reduction in weight-lifting capability through loss of wing area. This relatively strong diminution of load lifting by wing wear, observed over the range of wing area losses naturally accrued by wild bees, provides a potential mechanism for declining foraging ability and survivorship of worker bees with wing wear. What remains to be explained is the utter insensitivity of maximum load lifted to forewing asymmetry.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0008-4301\", \"EISSN: 0008-4301\", \"DOI: 10.1139/cjz-2013-0229\", \"CODEN: CJZOAG\", \"EISSN: 1480-3283\", \"ISSN: 1480-3283\"]}\n",

Here we screened 764 bumblebees from around five greenhouses that either used commercially produced bumblebees or did not, as well as bumblebees from 10 colonies placed at two sites either close to or far from a honey bee apiary, for the parasites Apicystis bombi, Crithidia bombi, Nosema bombi, N. ceranae, N. apis and deformed wing virus. We found that A. bombi and C. bombi were more prevalent around greenhouses using commercially produced bumblebees, while C. bombi was 18% more prevalent in bumblebees at the site near to the honey bee apiary than those at the site far from the apiary. Whilst these results are from only a limited number of sites, they support previous reports of parasite spillover from commercially produced bumblebees to wild bumblebees, and suggest that the impact of stress from competing with managed bees or the vectoring of parasites by them on parasite prevalence in wild bees needs further investigation.

For long‐term management and effective conservation of B. ignitus, an understanding of the genetic structure of its naturally occurring populations is practically important. In this study, the genetic structure among the five populations of B. ignitus in South Korea was assessed using nine microsatellite loci. These markers showed high levels of genetic variability, with the number of alleles ranging from 6 to 22 (mean = 13.4) and the frequency of the most common allele ranging from 0.11 to 0.66. Only the Sabuk (SB) population showed a genetic signature of a recent bottleneck, which was further supported by the lowest level of allelic richness (AR) (mean AR = 3.944). Genetic differentiation was highly significant among all pairs of populations (P < 0.001) across the nine microsatellite markers, suggesting a lack of gene flow among those populations. Interestingly, FST (and RST and Dest) values were always greater for the Taebaek population than for the four remaining populations. The phylogenetic analysis showed evidence supporting our hypothesis that the Taebaek population is genetically more divergent than the other populations.

In this study, we selected Cucurbita pepo L. (squash) as a model crop to investigate the relative importance of honey bees and bumblebees in pollinating the crop. Thirteen fields, which were surrounded by a gradient of natural habitat, were investigated on the Yunnan‐Guizhou Plateau in China. We measured the visit densities of honey bees and bumblebees, the number of pollen grains deposited in a single visit by the two bee taxa, as well as the overall pollen grains deposited on stigmas during a flowering day, and then used Bayesian inference to decouple the pollen grains deposited by either the honey bees or the bumblebees. Compared with honey bees, bumblebees deposited a higher number of pollen grains on stigmas in a single visit, but had a lower visit density than honey bees. Meanwhile, the bumblebee visit density increased along the proportion of natural habitat, while the honey bee visit density was not affected by the surrounding natural habitat. Data simulations using Bayesian inference showed that on a flowering day, the number of pollen grains deposited by bumblebees increased with the proportion of natural habitat in the surrounding landscape, but the number of pollen grains deposited by honey bees did not. Moreover, the total numbers of pollen grains deposited by honey bees or bumblebees alone were all below 2000 (the critical level to satisfy the pollination requirement of this crop). Pollen calculations demonstrated that the number of pollen grains deposited by the two bee taxa was greater than 2000 in fields surrounded by more than 13% natural habitat (grasslands and forests).

Here, for the first time, we assessed potential changes in the behavioural type of foragers during colony development. Using an ecologically relevant foraging task, we measured the decision speed and learning ability of bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) at different stages of colony development. We determined whether individuals that forage early in the colony life cycle (the queen and early emerging workers) behaved differently from workers that emerge and forage at the end of colony development. Whilst we found no overall change in the foraging behaviour of workers with colony development, there were strong differences in foraging behaviour between queens and their workers. Queens appeared to forage more cautiously than their workers and were also quicker to learn. These behaviours could allow queens to maximise their nectar collecting efficiency whilst avoiding predation. Because the foundress queen is crucial to the survival and success of a bumble bee colony, more efficient foraging behaviour in queens may have strong adaptive value.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0090556\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

While oligolectic species forage on pollen from a single family of host plants, polylectic bees, such as bumblebees, collect pollen from many families of plants. These polylectic species contend with interspecific variability in essential nutrients of their host-plants but we have only a limited understanding of the way in which chemicals and chemical combinations influence bee development and feeding behaviour. In this paper, we investigated five different pollen diets (Calluna vulgaris, Cistus sp., Cytisus scoparius, Salix caprea and Sorbus aucuparia) to determine how their chemical content affected bumblebee colony development and pollen/syrup collection. Three compounds were used to characterise pollen content: polypeptides, amino acids and sterols. Several parameters were used to determine the impact of diet on micro-colonies: (i) Number and weight of larvae (total and mean weight of larvae), (ii) weight of pollen collected, (iii) pollen efficacy (total weight of larvae divided by weight of the pollen collected) and (iv) syrup collection. Our results show that pollen collection is similar regardless of chemical variation in pollen diet while syrup collection is variable. Micro-colonies fed on S. aucuparia and C. scoparius pollen produced larger larvae (i.e. better mates and winter survivors) and fed less on nectar compared to the other diets. Pollen from both of these species contains 24-methylenecholesterol and high concentrations of polypeptides/total amino acids. This pollen nutritional \\\"theme\\\" seems therefore to promote worker reproduction in B. terrestris micro-colonies and could be linked to high fitness for queenright colonies. As workers are able to selectively forage on pollen of high chemical quality, plants may be evolutionarily selected for their pollen content, which might attract and increase the degree of fidelity of generalist pollinators, such as bumblebees.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0086209\"]}\n",

Although experimental studies confirmed that PCC volcanic ash negatively affects survival and behavior in many insect taxa, including bees, the effects of ash deposition on the plant-pollinator interactions (PPI) of this group of insects in natural landscapes remained untested. We evaluated the effect of the gradient of increasing ash layer thickness (0-15cm) on: (1) number of wild bees visiting flowers and total bee richness in 16 raspberry fields after the eruption, (2) number of native (Bombus dahlbomii) and invasive (B. terrestris and B. ruderatus) bumble bees foraging on wild flowers in 10 sites before and after the eruption, and (3) the proportion of “triggered” flowers (i.e. papilionaceous flowers visited for first time by large bees) in 32 populations of the invasive shrub scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius), before and after the eruption.

It is still unknown, however, whether a non-ingestive reward pathway for pollen learning exists, and how foraging bees sense differences between pollen types. Here we adopt a novel experimental approach testing the learning ability of bees with pollen rewards. Bumblebees were reared under controlled laboratory conditions. To establish which pollen rewards are distinguishable, individual bees were given the choice of collecting two types of pollen, diluted to varying degrees with indigestible α-cellulose. Bees preferentially collected a particular pollen type, but this was not always the most concentrated sample. Preferences were influenced by the degree of similarity between samples and also by the period of exposure, with bees more readily collecting samples of lower pollen concentration after five trials. When trained differentially, bees were able to associate an initially less-preferred contextual colour with the more concentrated sample, whilst their pollen preferences did not change. Successful learning of contextual cues seems to maintain pollen foraging preferences over repeated exposures, suggesting that fast learning of floral cues may preclude continuous sampling and evaluation of alternative reward sources, leading to constancy in pollen foraging.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 1477-9145\", \"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.106120\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\", \"PMID: 24855678\"]}\n",

Despite the importance of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) as global pollinators, little is known regarding how pollen collection patterns vary between individuals, colonies, and landscapes. In this study, Vosnesensky bumble bees (Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski) were collected from a range of human-altered and natural landscapes in northern California. Extensive vegetation surveys and Geographic Information System (GIS)-based habitat classifications were conducted at each site, bees were genotyped to identify colony mates, and pollen loads were examined to identify visited plants. In contrast to predictions based on strong competitive interactions, pollen load composition was significantly more similar for bees captured in a shared study region compared with bees throughout the research area but was not significantly more similar for colony mates. Preference analyses revealed that pollen loads were not composed of the most abundant plant species per study region. The majority of ranked pollen preference lists were significantly correlated for pairwise comparisons of colony mates and individuals within a study region, whereas the majority of pairwise comparisons of ranked pollen preference lists between individuals located at separate study regions were uncorrelated. Results suggest that pollen load composition and foraging preferences are similar for bees throughout a shared landscape regardless of colony membership. The importance of native plant species in pollen collection is illustrated through preference analyses, and we suggest prioritization of specific rare native plant species for enhanced bumble bee pollen collection.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1603/EN13261\", \"PMID: 24763096\", \"EISSN: 1938-2936\", \"ISSN: 0046-225X\"]}\n",

Here, we review the available literature on insect telemetry using active (battery‐powered) radio transmitters and compare this technology to harmonic radar and radio frequency identification (<jats:styled-content style=\\\"fixed-case\\\">RFID</jats:styled-content>) which use passive tags (i.e. without a battery). The first radio telemetry studies with insects were published in the late 1980s, and subsequent studies have addressed aspects of insect ecology, behaviour and evolution. Most insect telemetry studies have focused on habitat use and movement, including quantification of movement paths, home range sizes, habitat selection, and movement distances. Fewer studies have addressed foraging behaviour, activity patterns, migratory strategies, or evolutionary aspects. The majority of radio telemetry studies have been conducted outside the tropics, usually with beetles (Coleoptera) and crickets (Orthoptera), but bees (Hymenoptera), dobsonflies (Megaloptera), and dragonflies (Odonata) have also been radio‐tracked. In contrast to the active transmitters used in radio telemetry, the much lower weight of harmonic radar and <jats:styled-content style=\\\"fixed-case\\\">RFID</jats:styled-content> tags allows them to be used with a broader range of insect taxa. However, the fixed detection zone of a stationary radar unit (< 1 km diameter) and the restricted detection distance of <jats:styled-content style=\\\"fixed-case\\\">RFID</jats:styled-content> tags (usually < 1–5 m) constitute major constraints of these technologies compared to radio telemetry. Most of the active transmitters in radio telemetry have been applied to insects with a body mass exceeding 1 g, but smaller species in the range 0.2–0.5 g (e.g. bumblebees and orchid bees) have now also been tracked. Current challenges of radio‐tracking insects in the field are related to the constraints of a small transmitter, including short battery life (7–21 days), limited tracking range on the ground (100–500 m), and a transmitter weight that sometimes approaches the weight of a given insect (the ratio of tag mass to body mass varies from 2 to 100%). The attachment of radio transmitters may constrain insect behaviour and incur significant energetic costs, but few studies have addressed this in detail. Future radio telemetry studies should address (i) a larger number of species from different insect families and functional groups, (ii) a better coverage of tropical regions, (iii) intraspecific variability between sexes, ages, castes, and individuals, and (iv) a larger tracking range via aerial surveys with helicopters and aeroplanes equipped with external antennae. Furthermore, field and laboratory studies, including observational and experimental approaches as well as theoretical modelling, could help to clarify the behavioural and energetic consequences of transmitter attachment. Finally, the development of commercially available systems for automated tracking and potential future options of insect telemetry from space will provide exciting new avenues for quantifying movement and space use of insects from local to global spatial scales.\", \"identifier\": [\"CODEN: BRCPAH\", \"PMID: 24106908\", \"EISSN: 1469-185X\", \"ISSN: 1464-7931\", \"DOI: 10.1111/brv.12065\"]}\n",

We tested if a radiating nectar guide around a nectary would enhance the ability of naïve bumble bee foragers to find nectar. Most experiments that test nectar guide efficacy, specifically radiating linear guides, have used guides positioned around the center of a radially symmetric flower, where nectaries are often found. However, the flower center may be intrinsically attractive. We therefore used an off-center guide and nectary and compared “conjunct” feeders with a nectar guide surrounding the nectary to “disjunct” feeders with a nectar guide separated from the nectary. We focused on the innate response of novice bee foragers that had never previously visited such feeders. We hypothesized that a disjunct nectar guide would conflict with the visual information provided by the nectary and negatively affect foraging. Approximately, equal numbers of bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) found nectar on both feeder types. On disjunct feeders, however, unsuccessful foragers spent significantly more time (on average 1.6-fold longer) searching for nectar than any other forager group. Successful foragers on disjunct feeders approached these feeders from random directions unlike successful foragers on conjunct feeders, which preferentially approached the combined nectary and nectar guide. Thus, the nectary and a surrounding nectar guide can be considered a combination of two signals that attract naïve foragers even when not in the floral center.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00114-014-1188-9\", \"PMID: 24879351\", \"ISSN: 0028-1042\", \"EISSN: 1432-1904\", \"ISSN: 1432-1904\"]}\n",

Given current interest in multimodal communication and recently discovered interplay between olfaction and vision in humans and Drosophila, understanding multisensory integration in bees is an opportunity to advance knowledge across fields. Using a classic ethological framework, we formulate proximate and ultimate perspectives on bees’ use of multisensory stimuli. We discuss interactions between scent and color in the context of bee cognition and perception, focusing on mechanistic and functional approaches, and we highlight opportunities to further explore the development and evolution of multisensory integration.

Female reproductive success was positively correlated with yellow morph frequency, at both the population scale and the local scale. Therefore, we failed to observe negative frequency‐dependent selection (NFDS), a mechanism commonly invoked to explain flower colour polymorphism in deceptive plant species. Flower size and local flower density could also affect female reproductive success in natural populations. Pollinator behaviour could explain the positive effect of the yellow morph, and our results suggest that flower colour polymorphism might not persist in I. lutescens, but alternative explanations not linked to pollinator behaviour are discussed.

In bees, whose colour vision is best studied among the insects, the compensation provided by colour constancy is only partial and its efficiency depends on the area of colour space. There is no evidence for complete ‘discounting’ of the illuminant in bees, and the spectral composition of the light can itself be used as adaptive information. In patchy illumination, bees adjust their spatial foraging to minimise transitions between variously illuminated zones.

Their resemblance to a flower has given rise to the hypothesis that they are flower mimics. However, floral mimicry as a predatory strategy, and in particular, how predatory floral mimicry functions at a mechanistic level is poorly understood. Two main morphological characteristics are thought to make orchid mantises appear similar to flowers and thus attractive to pollinators: (1) their ‘flower‐like’ white colouration and (2) their ‘petal‐shaped’ expansions of exoskeleton on their mid‐femur and hind femur (femoral lobes). I investigated the contribution of these colour and shape characteristics to pollinator attraction using artificial orchid mantis models. Models with the ‘flower‐like’ white colouration of the orchid mantis had higher rates of pollinator inspection than brown models. Manipulating overall body shape by removing or changing the orientation of the ‘petal‐shaped’ femoral lobes did not affect the attractiveness of models. As certain flower‐like characteristics (symmetry and petals) did not affect the attractiveness of models, pollinators may not necessarily cognitively misclassify orchid mantises as flowers. Rather, mantises may be exploiting sensory biases of their pollinator prey, and their UV‐absorbing white colouration may be sufficient to lure pollinators. The effectiveness of using artificial models established here provides a basis for future research into orchid mantis morphology and the fine‐scale interactions between orchid mantises and pollinators.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1111/eth.12238\", \"ISSN: 0179-1613\", \"EISSN: 1439-0310\"]}\n",

Phenotypic classifications were evaluated using observations of plant–pollinator interactions. Pollinator guilds differed in the number of visits made to flowers in different floral colour and shape categories, indicating that such categories were ecologically relevant. For species with complex flowers, each floral category contained few species, so that the observed low occurrence of co-flowering could be explained by chance. In contrast, within phenotypic categories species with simple flowers bloomed together more than expected at three sites, but these overlaps could be explained by family membership. Most species with complex flowers could be segregated into unique pollination niches by broad floral colour and shape categories, so that there was little opportunity for competition between flowers within such categories. Species with simple floral phenotypes were less well defined by floral phenotype and phenology. Historical sorting may explain differences between complex flowers, while co-flowering between species with simple flowers requires further investigation.

Two abundant hoverfly species also showed size effects, particularly when feeding for nectar.Mean size of foragers also varied diurnally, with larger individuals active earlier and later, so that pollination effectiveness varies through a day; flowers routinely pollinated by bees may best be served by early morning dehiscence and visits from larger individuals.Thus, while there are well-documented species-level variations in pollination effectiveness, the fine-scale individual differences between foragers should also be taken into account when assessing the reproductive outputs of biotically-pollinated plants.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1920-7603\", \"ISSN: 1920-7603\", \"DOI: 10.26786/1920-7603(2014)22\"]}\n",

In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant Harpegnathos saltator. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dopamine. Dopamine levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how dopamine may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dopamine levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dopamine. In addition to dopamine, levels of serotonin and tyramine differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in behavior and dominance with reproductive activity in H. saltator as well as drive differences in worker task performance.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.098301\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\", \"PMID: 24436385\"]}\n",

Both the phylogenetic structure and trait composition of flowering plant communities may be expected to change with altitude. In particular, floral colours are thought to vary with altitude because Hymenoptera typically decline in importance as pollinators while Diptera and Lepidoptera become more important at higher elevations. Thus, ecological filtering among elevation zones and competitive processes among co-occurring species within zones could influence the floral chromatic cues present at low and high elevations. 2. We collected data from 107 species of native flowering plants in the Himalaya Mountains of central Nepal over an elevation range of 900–4100 m, which includes habitat ranging from subtropical to subalpine within a relatively small geographical area. Using a phylogenetic framework, we asked whether and how flower colour diversity differed between species assemblages at lower and higher elevation, between monocots and eudicots, and between our sample from central Nepal and angiosperms from other regions of the world. 3. There was significant phylogenetic clustering in the communities as a result of monocots, particularly orchids, which were found overwhelmingly at lower elevations. Phylogenetic signal for floral colours indicated that related species had colours that were more disparate than expected under Brownian motion evolution. Floral colours were significantly more diverse in the higher elevation subalpine zone than in the subtropical zone. However, the chromatic cues at both elevations were consistent with the hue discrimination abilities of the trichromatic hymenopteran visual system. 4. Synthesis. Flower colour is not highly differentiated between subtropical and subalpine vegetation due to differences in the available orders of insect pollinators, or by the rate or direction of colour evolution in the lineages composing the two communities. Differences in colour diversity between zones may reflect differences in the ecologically available morphospace based on pollinator species richness and the constancy of their foraging behaviour. The chromatic signals present in Nepali species are similar to the signals found in insect-pollinated floras of other regions of the world.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0022-0477\", \"CODEN: JECOAB\", \"ISSN: 1365-2745\", \"DOI: 10.1111/1365-2745.12185\", \"EISSN: 1365-2745\"]}\n",

Crithidia mellificae is a unicellular eukaryotic honey bee parasite that has been associated with colony losses in the USA and Belgium. C. mellificae is a member of the family Trypanosomatidae, which primarily includes other insect-infecting species (e.g., the bumble bee pathogen Crithidia bombi), as well as species that infect both invertebrate and vertebrate hosts including human pathogens (e.g.,Trypanosoma cruzi, T. brucei, and Leishmania spp.).

The 32 megabase draft genome, presented herein, shares a high degree of conservation with the related species Leishmania major. We estimate that C. mellificae encodes over 8,300 genes, the majority of which are orthologs of genes encoded by L. major and other Leishmania or Trypanosoma species. Genes unique to C. mellificae, including those of possible bacterial origin, were annotated based on function and include genes putatively involved in carbohydrate metabolism.

But this is a highly derived state and not a prerequisite for a functional society. Rather, caste-flexibility is a central feature in many eusocial wasps, where adult females have the potential to become queens or workers, depending on the social environment. In non-swarming paper wasps (e.g., Polistes), prospective queens fight one another to assert their dominance, with losers becoming workers if they remain on the nest. This aggression is fueled by juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroids, major factors involved in caste differentiation in most eusocial insects. We tested whether these hormones have conserved aggression-promoting functions in Synoeca surinama, a caste-flexible swarm-founding wasp (Epiponini) where reproductive competition is high and aggressive displays are common. RESULTS: We observed the behavioral interactions of S. surinama females in field nests before and after we had removed the egg-laying queen(s). We measured the ovarian reproductive status, hemolymph JH and ecdysteroid titers, ovarian ecdysteroid content, and analyzed the cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) composition of females engaged in competitive interactions in both queenright and queenless contexts. These data, in combination with hormone manipulation experiments, revealed that neither JH nor ecdysteroids are necessary for the expression of dominance behaviors in S. surinama. Instead, we show that JH likely functions as a gonadotropin and directly modifies the cuticular hydrocarbon blend of young workers to match that of a reproductive. Hemolymph ecdysteroids, in contrast, are not different between queens and workers despite great differences in ovarian ecdysteroid content. CONCLUSIONS: The endocrine profile of S. surinama shows surprising differences from those of other caste-flexible wasps, although a rise in JH titers in replacement queens is a common theme. Extensive remodeling of hormone functions is also evident in the highly eusocial bees, which has been attributed to the evolution of morphologically defined castes. Our results show that hormones which regulate caste-plasticity can lose these roles even while caste-plasticity is preserved.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1742-9994\", \"DOI: 10.1186/s12983-014-0078-5\", \"ISSN: 1742-9994\", \"PMID: 25371699\"]}\n",

We here tested whether experience gained by repeated tending of low-level fungus-exposed (Metarhizium robertsii) larvae may alter the performance of sanitary brood care in the clonal ant, Platythyrea punctata. We trained ants individually over nine consecutive trials to either sham-treated or fungus-exposed larvae. We then compared the larval grooming behavior of naive and trained ants and measured how effectively they removed infectious fungal conidiospores from the fungus-exposed larvae. We found that the ants changed the duration of larval grooming in response to both, larval treatment and their level of experience: (1) sham-treated larvae received longer grooming than the fungus-exposed larvae and (2) trained ants performed less self-grooming but longer larval grooming than naive ants, which was true for both, ants trained to fungus-exposed and also to sham-treated larvae. Ants that groomed the fungus-exposed larvae for longer periods removed a higher number of fungal conidiospores from the surface of the fungus-exposed larvae. As experienced ants performed longer larval grooming, they were more effective in fungal removal, thus making them better caretakers under pathogen attack of the colony. By studying this clonal ant, we can thus conclude that even in the absence of genetic variation between colony members, differences in experience levels of brood care may affect performance of sanitary brood care in social insects.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00265-014-1778-8\", \"EISSN: 1432-0762\", \"ISSN: 0340-5443\"]}\n",

These transposases exhibited high similarity of 97.9 % among themselves. In case of\\nCasmar1\\n, the presence of an intact ORF was found in high frequencies (i.e., 11 out of 12 clones). In addition, these transposases also showed the presence of a terminal inverted repeat-binding motif, DD(34)D and two highly conserved amino acid motifs, (W/L)(I/L)PHQL and YSP(D/N)L(A/S)P. These two motifs differed from previously known motifs, WVPHEL and YSPDLAP. MLEs isolated from these three different species may have been inserted into their genomes by horizontal transfer. Furthermore, the presence of an intact ORF suggests that they are still active in habitats along these isolated islands.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1573-6857\", \"ISSN: 0016-6707\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s10709-014-9762-9\", \"PMID: 24723149\"]}\n",

Body weight of females was significantly higher than that of males, irrespectively both, the pollen fed and the age class. Weight of freshly emerged females was significantly superior when fed with pollen of P. tomentosa and Z. mays compared to those fed with B. pendula or H. annuus pollen. Biomass of females significantly increased until the age of 3 days, then remaining constant or decreasing until the age of 30 days. Weight gain with ageing is explained by higher food uptake by females for egg production and egg maturation. Weight gain of males also reached its maximum at day 3 of adult life, then decreasing until day 30. Congruent with biomass, adult body length and width differed significantly between sex and age showing females bigger than males and 30 day old adults bigger than 1 day old adults irrespectively the pollen fed. Both the parameters were affected by pollen, revealing P. tomentosa as best food source, followed by Z. mays and B. pendula.

Floral food deception has been frequently recorded in orchids; however, there is little evidence for food deception outside the Orchidaceae. One putative non-orchid candidate is the Mediterranean Iris lutescens , which displays an heritable polymorphism for flower colour, with yellow and purple morphs. Colour polymorphism is frequently thought to be maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection, where rare morphs are visited more frequently than common ones. Here, we present data on reproductive biology and pollination ecology of the species in the light of the deceptive pollination strategy and the maintenance of flower colour polymorphism. There was no difference in sex allocation and flowering phenology between morphs, with a blooming period early in spring. Both colour morphs are equally self-incompatible and they depend on insects for seed production. The most common visitors with pollen loads are small and large Apoids. These were observed foraging for non-existent nectar (rather than pollen) on Iris flowers. Most of them appear to learn to avoid Iris flowers as classically observed for rewardless species, and there was no evidence of an advantage for the rare morph. Instead, we found that in some populations, large bee pollinators appeared to prefer the most common morph (positive frequency-dependent selection).

The contribution of the neonicotinoid insecticides (e.g., clothianidin and imidacloprid) to this decline is controversial, and key to understanding their risk is whether the astonishingly low levels found in the nectar and pollen of plants is sufficient to deliver neuroactive levels to their site of action: the bee brain. Here we show that bumblebees (Bombus terrestris andax) fed field levels [10 nM, 2.1 ppb (w/w)] of neonicotinoid accumulate between 4 and 10 nM in their brains within 3 days. Acute (minutes) exposure of cultured neurons to 10 nM clothianidin, but not imidacloprid, causes a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor‐dependent rapid mitochondrial depolarization. However, a chronic (2 days) exposure to 1 nM imidacloprid leads to a receptor‐dependent increased sensitivity to a normally innocuous level of acetylcholine, which now also causes rapid mitochondrial depolarization in neurons. Finally, colonies exposed to this level of imidacloprid show deficits in colony growth and nest condition compared with untreated colonies. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the poor navigation and foraging observed in neonicotinoid treated bumblebee colonies.—Moffat, C., Pacheco, J. G., Sharp, S., Samson, A.

The quantity of individual essential amino acids (EAAs) obtained from dietary protein depends on the protein source, but how the proportion of EAAs in the diet affects nutrient balancing has rarely been studied. Recent research using the Geometric Framework for Nutrition has revealed that forager honeybees who receive much of their dietary EAAs from floral nectar and not from solid protein have relatively low requirements for dietary EAAs. Here, we examined the nutritional requirements for protein and carbohydrates of foragers of the buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris. By using protein (sodium caseinate) or an equimolar mixture of the 10 EAAs, we found that the intake target (nutritional optimum) of adult workers depended on the source and proportion of dietary EAAs. When bees consumed caseinate-containing diets in a range of ratios between 1:250 and 1:25 (protein to carbohydrate), they achieved an intake target (IT) of 1:149 (w/w). In contrast to those fed protein, bees fed the EAA diets had an IT more biased towards carbohydrates (1:560 w/w) but also had a greater risk of death than those fed caseinate. We also tested how the dietary source of EAAs affected free AAs in bee haemolymph. Bees fed diets near their IT had similar haemolymph AA profiles, whereas bees fed diets high in caseinate had elevated levels of leucine, threonine, valine and alanine in the haemolymph. We found that like honeybees, bumblebee workers prioritize carbohydrate intake and have a relatively low requirement for protein. The dietary source of EAAs influenced both the ratio of protein/EAA to carbohydrate and the overall amount of carbohydrate eaten. Our data support the idea that EAAs and carbohydrates in haemolymph are important determinants of nutritional state in insects.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\", \"PMID: 25617453\", \"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.114249\"]}\n",

RESULTS: Bees exposed to imidacloprid displayed a significant dose‐dependent reduction in consumption at 10 and 100 µg L⁻¹, which was reversed when untreated feed was offered. No consistent avoidance/antifeedant response to nectar substitute with thiamethoxam was detected at the more field‐realistic dose rates of 1 and 10 µg L⁻¹, and exposure to the very high 100 µg L⁻¹ dose rate was followed by 100% mortality of experimental insects. No reduction in food intake was recorded at 1 µg clothianidin L⁻¹, reduced consumption was noted at 10 µg clothianidin L⁻¹ and 100% mortality occurred when bees were exposed to rates of 100 µg clothianidin L⁻¹.

Nonetheless, only few studies have been carried out with pollinators, usually emphasizing the honeybee Apis mellifera and neglecting other important pollinator species such as the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. Here, lethal and sublethal effects of azadirachtin were studied on B. terrestris via oral exposure in the laboratory to bring out the potential risks of the compound to this important pollinator. The compound was tested at different concentrations above and below the maximum concentration that is used in the field (32 mg L⁻¹). As most important results, azadirachtin repelled bumblebee workers in a concentration-dependent manner. The median repellence concentration (RC₅₀) was estimated as 504 mg L⁻¹. Microcolonies chronically exposed to azadirachtin via treated sugar water during 11 weeks in the laboratory exhibited a high mortality ranging from 32 to 100 % with a range of concentrations between 3.2 and 320 mg L⁻¹. Moreover, no reproduction was scored when concentrations were higher than 3.2 mg L⁻¹. At 3.2 mg L⁻¹, azadirachtin significantly inhibited the egg-laying and, consequently, the production of drones during 6 weeks. Ovarian length decreased with the increase of the azadirachtin concentration. When azadirachtin was tested under an experimental setup in the laboratory where bumblebees need to forage for food, the sublethal effects were stronger as the numbers of drones were reduced already with a concentration of 0.64 mg L⁻¹. Besides, a negative correlation was found between the body mass of male offspring and azadirachtin concentration. In conclusion, our results as performed in the laboratory demonstrated that azadirachtin can affect B. terrestris with a range of sublethal effects. Taking into account that sublethal effects are as important as lethal effects for the development and survival of the colonies of B. terrestris, this study confirms the need to test compounds on their safety, especially when they have to perform complex tasks such as foraging. The latter agrees with the recent European Food Safety Authority guidelines to assess ‘potentially deleterious’ compounds for sublethal effects on behavior.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1573-3017\", \"ISSN: 0963-9292\", \"CODEN: ECOTEL\", \"PMID: 25300506\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s10646-014-1365-9\"]}\n",

However, little is known about how environmental factors affect bacterial community structure. We analysed the gut microbiota from three groups of worker bumblebees (B. terrestris) from distinct colonies that varied in rearing and foraging characteristics: commercially reared with restricted foraging (RR); commercially reared with outside foraging (RF); and wild‐caught workers (W). Contrary to previous studies, which indicate that bacterial communities are highly conserved across workers, we found that RF individuals had an intermediate community structure compared with RR and W types.

Yet, little is known about visual learning and memory in males despite the fact that in most bee species males must take care of their own needs and must find rewarding flowers to obtain food. Here we used the proboscis extension response (PER) paradigm to study the color learning capacities of workers and drones of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris. Light stimuli were paired with sucrose reward delivered to the insects' antennae and inducing a reflexive extension of the proboscis. We evaluated color learning (i.e. conditioned PER to color stimuli) in absolute and differential conditioning protocols and mid-term memory retention was measured two hours after conditioning. Different monochromatic light stimuli in combination with neutral density filters were used to ensure that the bumblebees could only use chromatic and not achromatic (e.g. brightness) information. Furthermore, we tested if bees were able to transfer the learned information from the PER conditioning to a novel discrimination task in a Y-maze. Both workers and drones were capable of learning and discriminating between monochromatic light stimuli and retrieved the learned stimulus after two hours. Drones performed as well as workers during conditioning and in the memory test, but failed in the transfer test in contrast to workers. Our data clearly show that bumblebees can learn to associate a color stimulus with a sugar reward in PER conditioning and that both workers and drones reach similar acquisition and mid-term retention performances. Additionally, we provide evidence that only workers transfer the learned information from a Pavlovian to an operant situation.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0134248\", \"PMID: 26230643\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

We identified 57 compounds, with 52 of them never described in bumblebee venom. Remarkably, 72% of the detected compounds were found to have a honeybee venom homolog, which reflects the similar defensive function of both venoms and the high degree of homology between both genomes.

By composite interval mapping (IM), we found 83 and 34 suggestive QTLs for 19 of the 20 traits at the linkage group wide significance levels of p = 0.05 and 0.01, respectively.

Multivariate principal components analysis confirmed 11 univariate suggestive QTLs but revealed three suggestive QTLs not identified by the individual traits.

The clear division of reproduction between a single founding queen and the largely sterile workers is characteristic for highly eusocial species, whereas the morphological similarity between the bumble bee queen and the workers is typical for more primitively eusocial hymenopterans. Also, unlike other highly eusocial hymenopterans, division of labour among worker subcastes is plastic and not predetermined by morphology or age. We conducted a differential expression analysis based on RNA‐seq data from 11 combinations of developmental stage and caste to investigate how a single genome can produce the distinct castes of queens, workers and males in the buff‐tailed bumble bee Bombus terrestris. Based on expression patterns, we found males to be the most distinct of all adult castes (2411 transcripts differentially expressed compared to nonreproductive workers). However, only relatively few transcripts were differentially expressed between males and workers during development (larvae: 71 and pupae: 162). This indicates the need for more distinct expression patterns to control behaviour and physiology in adults compared to those required to create different morphologies. Among female castes, reproductive workers and their nonreproductive sisters displayed differential expression in over ten times more transcripts compared to the differential expression found between reproductive workers and their mother queen. This suggests a strong shift towards a more queenlike behaviour and physiology when a worker becomes fertile. This contrasts with eusocial species where reproductive workers are more similar to nonreproductive workers than the queen.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1365-294X\", \"ISSN: 0962-1083\", \"PMID: 25913260\", \"EISSN: 1365-294X\", \"DOI: 10.1111/mec.13215\"]}\n",

B. terrestris is a common pollinator of wild flowers in Europe and is used for biological pollination in agriculture. Infection experiments demonstrated a similar pathology and tissue tropism in bumblebees as reported for honeybees. The effect of oral administration of virus-specific dsRNA was examined and resulted in an effective silencing of the virus, irrespective of the length.

Primitively eusocial bumblebees are uniquely placed to illuminate the evolution of highly eusocial insect societies. Bumblebees are also invaluable natural and agricultural pollinators, and there is widespread concern over recent population declines in some species. High-quality genomic data will inform key aspects of bumblebee biology, including susceptibility to implicated population viability threats.\\nWe report the high quality draft genome sequences of Bombus terrestris and Bombus impatiens, two ecologically dominant bumblebees and widely utilized study species. Comparing these new genomes to those of the highly eusocial honeybee Apis mellifera and other Hymenoptera, we identify deeply conserved similarities, as well as novelties key to the biology of these organisms. Some honeybee genome features thought to underpin advanced eusociality are also present in bumblebees, indicating an earlier evolution in the bee lineage. Xenobiotic detoxification and immune genes are similarly depauperate in bumblebees and honeybees, and multiple categories of genes linked to social organization, including development and behavior, show high conservation. Key differences identified include a bias in bumblebee chemoreception towards gustation from olfaction, and striking differences in microRNAs, potentially responsible for gene regulation underlying social and other traits.\\nThese two bumblebee genomes provide a foundation for post-genomic research on these key pollinators and insect societies. Overall, gene repertoires suggest that the route to advanced eusociality in bees was mediated by many small changes in many genes and processes, and not by notable expansion or depauperation.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1474-760X\", \"EISSN: 1465-6906\", \"DOI: 10.1186/s13059-015-0623-3\", \"EISSN: 1465-6914\", \"ISSN: 1465-6906\", \"PMID: 25908251\", \"EISSN: 1474-760X\", \"ISSN: 1474-7596\"]}\n",

By composite interval mapping (IM), we found 83 and 34 suggestive QTLs for 19 of the 20 traits at the linkage group wide significance levels of p = 0.05 and 0.01, respectively. Furthermore, we also found five significant QTLs at the genome wide significant level of p = 0.05. Individual QTLs accounted for 7.5-53.3% of the phenotypic variation. For 15 traits, at least one QTL was confirmed with multiple QTL model mapping. Multivariate principal components analysis confirmed 11 univariate suggestive QTLs but revealed three suggestive QTLs not identified by the individual traits. We also identified several candidate genes linked with light sensitivity, in particular the Phosrestin-1-like gene is a primary candidate for its phototransduction function.

In bumblebees (Bombus terrestris), pentacosane (C25) was suggested to serve as a queen pheromone. Here, we repeat these studies using a different species of bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) with a more controlled experimental design. Instead of dequeened colonies, we used same-aged, three-worker queenless groups comprising either experienced or naive workers (with/without adult exposure to queen pheromone). We quantified three hydrocarbons (C23, C25 and C27) on the cuticular surfaces of females and tested their effects on the two worker types. Our results indicate differences in responses of naive and experienced workers, genetic effects on worker reproduction, and general effects of hydrocarbons and duration of egg laying on ovary resorption rates.

The perceptual distance between the colours of each pair was similar according to the CH model but varied widely according to the COC and RN models. The time that bees required to select a flower and the proportion of correct choices differed between groups: decision times decreased as achromatic contrast increased, and the proportion of correct choices increased with achromatic contrast and perceptual distance, as predicted by the COC and RN models. These results suggest that both chromatic and achromatic contrasts affected the discriminability of colour pairs.

Since then, many studies confirmed the color learning capabilities of females from various hymenopteran species. Yet, little is known about visual learning and memory in males despite the fact that in most bee species males must take care of their own needs and must find rewarding flowers to obtain food. Here we used the proboscis extension response (PER) paradigm to study the color learning capacities of workers and drones of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris. Light stimuli were paired with sucrose reward delivered to the insects' antennae and inducing a reflexive extension of the proboscis. We evaluated color learning (i.e. conditioned PER to color stimuli) in absolute and differential conditioning protocols and mid-term memory retention was measured two hours after conditioning. Different monochromatic light stimuli in combination with neutral density filters were used to ensure that the bumblebees could only use chromatic and not achromatic (e.g. brightness) information. Furthermore, we tested if bees were able to transfer the learned information from the PER conditioning to a novel discrimination task in a Y-maze. Both workers and drones were capable of learning and discriminating between monochromatic light stimuli and retrieved the learned stimulus after two hours. Drones performed as well as workers during conditioning and in the memory test, but failed in the transfer test in contrast to workers. Our data clearly show that bumblebees can learn to associate a color stimulus with a sugar reward in PER conditioning and that both workers and drones reach similar acquisition and mid-term retention performances. Additionally, we provide evidence that only workers transfer the learned information from a Pavlovian to an operant situation.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0134248\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

Many male-female or insect-plant interactions depend on this phenomenon. Especially communication among individuals within social groups depends on innate behaviors. One example is the efficient recruitment of nest mates by successful bumblebee foragers. Returning foragers release a recruitment pheromone in the nest while they perform a 'dance' behavior to activate unemployed nest mates. A major component of this pheromone is the sesquiterpenoid farnesol. How farnesol is processed and perceived by the olfactory system, has not yet been identified. It is much likely that processing farnesol involves an innate mechanism for the extraction of relevant information to trigger a fast and reliable behavioral response. To test this hypothesis, we used population response analyses of 100 antennal lobe (AL) neurons recorded in alive bumblebee workers under repeated stimulation with four behaviorally different, but chemically related odorants (geraniol, citronellol, citronellal and farnesol). The analysis identified a unique neural representation of the recruitment pheromone component compared to the other odorants that are predominantly emitted by flowers. The farnesol induced population activity in the AL allowed a reliable separation of farnesol from all other chemically related odor stimuli we tested. We conclude that the farnesol induced population activity may reflect a predetermined representation within the AL-neural network allowing efficient and fast extraction of a behaviorally relevant stimulus. Furthermore, the results show that population response analyses of multiple single AL-units may provide a powerful tool to identify distinct representations of behaviorally relevant odors.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0137413\", \"PMID: 26340263\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that capsid protein gene was directly detected with below 200ng total RNA. This result suggests that an optimized detection via qRT-PCR can be applied for the rapid and sensitive diagnosis of BQCV infection in the field population as well as risk assessment of B. terrestris.\\n[Display omitted]\\n•BQCV polyprotein was amplified from field population of Bombus terrestris.•Detection of BQCV was optimized via qRT-PCR with below 200ng total RNA.•An optimized detection via qRT-PCR can be applied for diagnosis of BQCV as well as risk assessment of Bombus terrestris.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1226-8615\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.aspen.2014.10.010\", \"EISSN: 1876-7990\"]}\n",

Despite this risk, honeybees and other sequenced social insects have far fewer canonical immune genes relative to solitary insects. Social protection from infection, including behavioral responses, may explain this depauperate immune repertoire. Here, based on full genome sequences, we describe the immune repertoire of two ecologically and commercially important bumblebee species that diverged approximately 18 million years ago, the North American Bombus impatiens and European Bombus terrestris.\\nWe find that the immune systems of these bumblebees, two species of honeybee, and a solitary leafcutting bee, are strikingly similar. Transcriptional assays confirm the expression of many of these genes in an immunological context and more strongly in young queens than males, affirming Bateman's principle of greater investment in female immunity. We find evidence of positive selection in genes encoding antiviral responses, components of the Toll and JAK/STAT pathways, and serine protease inhibitors in both social and solitary bees. Finally, we detect many genes across pathways that differ in selection between bumblebees and honeybees, or between the social and solitary clades.\\nThe similarity in immune complement across a gradient of sociality suggests that a reduced immune repertoire predates the evolution of sociality in bees. The differences in selection on immune genes likely reflect divergent pressures exerted by parasites across social contexts.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1186/s13059-015-0628-y\", \"EISSN: 1465-6906\", \"PMID: 25908406\", \"EISSN: 1465-6914\", \"ISSN: 1465-6906\", \"EISSN: 1474-760X\", \"ISSN: 1474-7596\"]}\n",

We examined how these factors interact to affect flower colour preference in the large earth bumblebee, Bombus terrestris dalmatinus. Individual bees with no experience foraging on coloured flowers were first tested for innate colour biases on an unrewarded array of blue and yellow artificial flowers. Depending on treatment, bees then acquired individual experience foraging on a colour (either blue or yellow) associated with high-quality sucrose rewards, or a colour with low-quality sucrose rewards, or they did not acquire any individual experience. Bees were then exposed to the alternative colour associated with conspecific demonstrator bees (social information) or the alternative colour with no social information. Bees that had no individual experience visited flower colours that were associated with conspecific demonstrators (social information) but only significantly if the socially demonstrated colour was one for which bees had an innate bias. When bees had individual experience foraging on a colour with high-quality rewards they continued foraging on that colour, and generally did not visit the socially demonstrated alternative colour, regardless of innate colour bias. Alternatively, when bees had individual experience foraging on colours with low-quality rewards, they made more visits to the socially demonstrated alternative flower colour, but only when the alternative colour was the colour for which they had an innate bias. Bees that had no access to social information continued to forage on low-reward coloured flowers. Thus we show that reward quality of resources with which bees have individual experience affects the use of social information but with an important role of innate biases.\\n•Bumblebee foraging decisions are affected by multiple sources of information.•Bees with no previous experience approach socially demonstrated colours.•Bees with experience of low rewards approach socially demonstrated colours.•Bees with experience of high rewards do not approach socially demonstrated colours.•Innate colour preferences affect the use of social information.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1095-8282\", \"ISSN: 0003-3472\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.12.016\", \"CODEN: ANBEA8\"]}\n",

As light levels fell, flight speed decreased and the flight trajectories became more tortuous but the bees were still remarkably good at centring their flight about the tunnel's midline. To investigate if this robust flight performance can be explained by visual adaptations in the bumblebee retina, we also examined the response speed of the green sensitive photoreceptors at the same light intensities. We found that the response speed of the photoreceptors significantly decreased as light levels fell. This indicates that bumblebees have both behavioural (reduction in flight speed) and retinal (reduction in response speed of the photoreceptors) adaptations to allow them to fly in dim light. However, the more tortuous flight paths recorded in dim light suggest that these adaptations do not support flight with the same precision during the twilight hours of the day.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 25750416\", \"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\", \"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.113886\"]}\n",

The flight paths consist of almost straight flight segments that are interspersed with rapid turns. These short and fast yaw turns (\\\"saccades\\\") are usually accompanied by even faster head yaw turns that change gaze direction. Since a large part of image rotation is thereby reduced to brief instants of time, this behavioural pattern facilitates depth perception from visual motion parallax during the intersaccadic intervals. The detailed analysis of the fine structure of the bees' head turning movements shows that the time course of single head saccades is very stereotypical. We find a consistent relationship between the duration, peak velocity and amplitude of saccadic head movements, which in its main characteristics resembles the so-called \\\"saccadic main sequence\\\" in humans. The fact that bumblebee head saccades are highly stereotyped as in humans, may hint at a common principle, where fast and precise motor control is used to reliably reduce the time during which the retinal images moves.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0135020\"]}\n",

Here we report an experiment using the plant Antirrhinum majus and the bumblebee Bombus terrestris to investigate how prior learning experience may affect pollinator preferences between floral types when these are presented together. We trained naive bumblebees to forage freely on flowering individuals of either A. majus pseudomajus (magenta flowers) or A. majus striatum (yellow flowers) in a flight cage. We then used a Y-maze device to expose trained bumblebees to a dual choice between the floral types. We tested the influence of training on their choice, depending on the type of plant signals available (visual signals, olfactory signals, or both). Bumblebees had no innate preference for either subspecies. Bumblebees trained on the yellow-flowered subspecies later preferred the yellow type, even when only visual or only olfactory signals were available, and their preference was not reinforced when both signal types were available. In contrast, bumblebees trained on the magenta-flowered subspecies showed no further preference between floral types and took slightly more time to make their choice. Since pollinator constancy has been observed in wild populations of A. majus with mixed floral types, we suggest that such constancy likely relies on short-term memory rather than acquired preference through long-term memory induced by prior learning.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0130225\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"PMID: 26263186\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

Unfortunately, bumblebees are challenged by various stress factors including insecticide applications. Today sublethal effects of various insecticides need to be thoroughly investigated to allow their combined use with pollinators and other beneficial organisms. In this study, we used lambda-cyhalothrin as a model pyrethroid insecticide and investigated lethal and sublethal effects by different dilutions, ranging from 1/10 to 1/100 of its maximum field recommended dosage (MFRC, 37.5 ppm), with the use of a chronic toxicity tests in the laboratory and in flight cages in the greenhouse. In the laboratory, small microcolonies with five bumblebee workers with one being pseudo-queen were used, while in the greenhouse we used queen-right mini-hives where the bumblebees need to fly for pyrethroid-contaminated food. We observed strong sublethal effects in the laboratory with treatments of 1/10 and 1/20 of the MFRC: the nest reproduction was reduced by 49 and 32 %, respectively, and the sugar water consumption by 36 %. With free-flying bumblebees, the toxic effects at 1/10 of the MFRC were more pronounced. A mortality of 88 ± 8 % was observed after only 2 weeks, being twice the mortality in the laboratory microcolonies test (43 ± 11 %).

In conclusion, our results demonstrated the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin with a range of lethal and sublethal effects, both crucial for the development and survival of the\\nB. terrestris\\ncolonies.

Thus, it can be expected that the structure and content of the fat body will adaptively change, if an insect is going through different life stages. Bumblebee queens belong to such insects as they dramatically change their physiology several times over their lives in relation to their solitary overwintering, independent colony foundation stage, and during the colony life-cycle ending in the senescent stage. Here, we report on changes in the ultrastructure and lipid composition of the peripheral fat body of Bombus terrestris queens in relation to seasonal changes in the queens' activity. Six life stages are defined and evaluated in particular: pharate, callow, before and after hibernation, egg-laying, and senescence. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the fat body contained two main cell types-adipocytes and oenocytes. Only adipocytes reveal important changes related to the life phase, and mostly the ration between inclusion and cytoplasm volume varies among particular stages. Both electron microscopy and chemical analyses of lipids highlighted seasonal variability in the quantity of the stored lipids, which peaked prior to hibernation. Triacylglycerols appeared to be the main energy source during hibernation, while the amount of glycogen before and after hibernation remained unchanged. In addition, we observed that the representation of some fatty acids within the triacylglycerols change during the queen's life. Last but not least, we show that fat body cell membranes do not undergo substantial changes concerning phospholipid composition in relation to overwintering. This finding supports the hypothesis that the cold-adaptation strategy of bumblebee queens is more likely to be based on polyol accumulation than on the restructuring of lipid membranes.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0142261\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

However, when the same types of flowers are arranged vertically, such as bees might naturally encounter on trees, they abandon their keen discrimination abilities, and visit flowers at random. We suggest that this poor discrimination reflects a foraging strategy fine-tuned to the ecological context.Pollinators have the capability of discriminating a wide variety of floral cues in order to identify rewarding flowers. However, little is known about how possible ecological or functional implications of horizontal and vertical positioning of flowers affect pollinator decision making. Flowers are commonly either arranged horizontally in meadows or vertically in inflorescences and blooming trees or bushes. Using bumblebees (Bombus terrestris), we here investigate if these 2 different foraging scenarios affect decision-making accuracy using an operant learning paradigm. Training foragers to feeders arranged either horizontally or vertically but bearing identical color or pattern cues, we found a highly significant and consistent difference in feeder choice accuracy. Bees presented with horizontally arranged feeders achieved accuracies of more than 90% by the end of the training. In contrast, bees foraging on vertically arranged feeders largely disregarded the feeder cues and accuracies remained well below 70%. Apart from feeder arrangement (horizontal, vertical) neither cue type (color, pattern), feeder display orientation (horizontal, vertical) nor vertical feeder distribution contributed significantly to choice accuracy. Training bees successively on vertical, horizontal, and vertical feeder arrays revealed that individual bees are capable of discriminating the presented feeder cues with high precision on the horizontal plane but did not use the acquired knowledge on subsequently presented vertically arranged feeders. Our results indicate that the spatial arrangement of flowers has marked effects on the foraging strategy employed by a generalist pollinator. We discuss the broader implications of foragers selectively allocating attention to focus on or disregard environmental information depending on spatial context.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1045-2249\", \"ISSN: 1465-7279\", \"DOI: 10.1093/beheco/arv010\", \"EISSN: 1465-7279\"]}\n",

We trained naive bumblebees to forage freely on flowering individuals of either A. majus pseudomajus (magenta flowers) or A. majus striatum (yellow flowers) in a flight cage. We then used a Y-maze device to expose trained bumblebees to a dual choice between the floral types. We tested the influence of training on their choice, depending on the type of plant signals available (visual signals, olfactory signals, or both). Bumblebees had no innate preference for either subspecies. Bumblebees trained on the yellow-flowered subspecies later preferred the yellow type, even when only visual or only olfactory signals were available, and their preference was not reinforced when both signal types were available. In contrast, bumblebees trained on the magenta-flowered subspecies showed no further preference between floral types and took slightly more time to make their choice.

Previous empirical studies showed that greater FMR, AR and EPI, and lower WL increase flight performance. In the Patagonian Chilean fjord where the study was carried out, B. dahlbomii was 40% heavier than B. terrestris, a difference theoretically allowing the queens of the native species to take off with heavier loads, despite the fact that the two species have virtually identical FMRs. However, FMR negatively depended on body mass at the intra-specific level. The total wing area was 35% greater in B. dahlbomii, but the difference in forewing length was only of 16%. Once taken into account the effect of body size, WL, was significantly lower in B. terrestris. AR increased with body mass and did not differ between species.

It has been proposed that Megalopta gain extra sensitivity by summing visual information over time. While enhancing the reliability of vision, this strategy would decrease the accuracy with which they can detect image motion-a crucial cue for flight control. Here, we test this temporal summation hypothesis by investigating how Megalopta's flight control and landing precision is affected by light intensity and compare our findings with the results of similar experiments performed on the diurnal bumblebee Bombus terrestris, to explore the extent to which Megalopta's adaptations to dim light affect their precision.

Many male-female or insect-plant interactions depend on this phenomenon. Especially communication among individuals within social groups depends on innate behaviors. One example is the efficient recruitment of nest mates by successful bumblebee foragers. Returning foragers release a recruitment pheromone in the nest while they perform a 'dance' behavior to activate unemployed nest mates. A major component of this pheromone is the sesquiterpenoid farnesol. How farnesol is processed and perceived by the olfactory system, has not yet been identified. It is much likely that processing farnesol involves an innate mechanism for the extraction of relevant information to trigger a fast and reliable behavioral response. To test this hypothesis, we used population response analyses of 100 antennal lobe (AL) neurons recorded in alive bumblebee workers under repeated stimulation with four behaviorally different, but chemically related odorants (geraniol, citronellol, citronellal and farnesol). The analysis identified a unique neural representation of the recruitment pheromone component compared to the other odorants that are predominantly emitted by flowers. The farnesol induced population activity in the AL allowed a reliable separation of farnesol from all other chemically related odor stimuli we tested. We conclude that the farnesol induced population activity may reflect a predetermined representation within the AL-neural network allowing efficient and fast extraction of a behaviorally relevant stimulus. Furthermore, the results show that population response analyses of multiple single AL-units may provide a powerful tool to identify distinct representations of behaviorally relevant odors.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0137413\"]}\n",

If species do exist in nature and can be discovered with available techniques, then we expect these revisions to converge on broadly shared interpretations of species. But for the primarily arctic bumblebees of the subgenus Alpinobombus of the genus Bombus, revisions by some of the most experienced specialists are unusual for bumblebees in that they have all reached different conclusions on the number of species present. Recent revisions based on skeletal morphology have concluded that there are from four to six species, while variation in colour pattern of the hair raised questions as to whether at least seven species might be present. Even more species are supported if we accept the recent move away from viewing species as morphotypes to viewing them instead as evolutionarily independent lineages (EILs) using data from genes. EILs are recognised here in practice from the gene coalescents that provide direct evidence for their evolutionary independence. We show from fitting both general mixed Yule/coalescent (GMYC) models and Poisson-tree-process (PTP) models to data for the mitochondrial COI gene that there is support for nine species in the subgenus Alpinobombus. Examination of the more slowly evolving nuclear PEPCK gene shows further support for a previously unrecognised taxon as a new species in northwestern North America. The three pairs of the most morphologically similar sister species are separated allopatrically and prevented from interbreeding by oceans. We also find that most of the species show multiple shared colour patterns, giving the appearance of mimicry among parts of the different species.

They have evolved a sophisticated recognition system which enables them to reject foreign individuals, and therefore prevent their nest's exploitation by parasites and predators. Nonetheless, many social parasites are able to overcome social insect recognition and parasitize their parental care behaviour by laying their eggs in host nests. Although several studies have already been conducted on the strategies used by social parasites to successfully invade host nests, the strategy used by its offspring to evade host rejection is still poorly understood. In bumblebees, previous investigations indicated that male offspring of Bombus vestalis (Geoffroy) (Hymeno‐ptera: Apidae), the specific obligate social parasite of Bombus terrestris (L.), may use allomones to evade host worker attacks. Following these studies, we performed electrophysiological studies and behavioural experiments to identify the potential repellents. Six compounds elicited electroantennographic responses in host worker antennae. The corresponding mixture of synthetic volatiles as well as pure tetradecyl acetate, and to a lesser extent pure (Z)‐11‐hexadecenyl acetate, showed a repellent effect on starved host workers in a feeding bioassay.

It is of considerable concern that the anthropogenic movement of bees species for crop pollination purposes has led to the accidental introduction of bee parasites to countries and continents where they do not naturally occur, exposing native bees to parasites against which they may have little resistance. In at least one instance, that of the South American bumble bee Bombus dahlbomii, this has led to a catastrophic population collapse.

Previously, it has been shown that when bumblebees encounter sudden changes in the proximity to nearby surfaces – as indicated by a change in the magnitude of optic flow on each side of the visual field – they adjust their flight speed well before the change, suggesting that they measure optic flow for speed control at low visual angles in the frontal visual field. Here, we investigated the effect that sudden changes in the magnitude of translational optic flow have on both position and speed control in bumblebees if these changes are asymmetrical; that is, if they occur only on one side of the visual field. Our results reveal that the visual region over which bumblebees respond to optic flow cues for flight control is not dictated by a set viewing angle. Instead, bumblebees appear to use the maximum magnitude of translational optic flow experienced in the frontal visual field. This strategy ensures that bumblebees use the translational optic flow generated by the nearest obstacles – that is, those with which they have the highest risk of colliding – to control flight.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\", \"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.107409\", \"PMID: 25657205\"]}\n",

There was no significant correlation between the estimates obtained by the three techniques, suggesting that each technique captured a different aspect of local bumblebee population size and distribution in the landscape. Bumblebee abundance as observed on the transects was positively influenced by the number of flowers present on the transect. The number of bumblebees caught in pan traps was positively influenced by the density of flowers surrounding the trapping location and negatively influenced by wider landscape heterogeneity. Molecular estimates of the number of nests of Bombus terrestris and B. hortorum were positively associated with the proportion of the landscape covered in oilseed rape and field beans. Both direct survey techniques are strongly affected by floral abundance immediately around the survey site, potentially leading to misleading results if attempting to infer overall abundance in an area or on a farm. In contrast, whilst the molecular method suffers from an inability to detect sister pairs at low sample sizes, it appears to be unaffected by the abundance of forage and thus is the preferred survey technique.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00442-015-3255-0\", \"EISSN: 1432-1939\", \"ISSN: 0029-8549\", \"PMID: 25676106\"]}\n",

Here I present a simple re-analysis of this data set. It demonstrates that these data in fact do show a negative relationship between both colony growth and queen production and the levels of neonicotinoids in the food stores collected by the bees. Indeed, this is the first study describing substantial negative impacts of neonicotinoids on colony performance of any bee species with free-flying bees in a field realistic situation where pesticide exposure is provided only as part of normal farming practices.

Thus, it can be expected that the structure and content of the fat body will adaptively change, if an insect is going through different life stages. Bumblebee queens belong to such insects as they dramatically change their physiology several times over their lives in relation to their solitary overwintering, independent colony foundation stage, and during the colony life-cycle ending in the senescent stage. Here, we report on changes in the ultrastructure and lipid composition of the peripheral fat body of Bombus terrestris queens in relation to seasonal changes in the queens' activity. Six life stages are defined and evaluated in particular: pharate, callow, before and after hibernation, egg-laying, and senescence. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the fat body contained two main cell types-adipocytes and oenocytes. Only adipocytes reveal important changes related to the life phase, and mostly the ration between inclusion and cytoplasm volume varies among particular stages. Both electron microscopy and chemical analyses of lipids highlighted seasonal variability in the quantity of the stored lipids, which peaked prior to hibernation. Triacylglycerols appeared to be the main energy source during hibernation, while the amount of glycogen before and after hibernation remained unchanged. In addition, we observed that the representation of some fatty acids within the triacylglycerols change during the queen's life. Last but not least, we show that fat body cell membranes do not undergo substantial changes concerning phospholipid composition in relation to overwintering. This finding supports the hypothesis that the cold-adaptation strategy of bumblebee queens is more likely to be based on polyol accumulation than on the restructuring of lipid membranes.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 26559946\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0142261\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

When ingested, nicotine delayed the progression of a gut infection in bumblebees by a few days, but dietary nicotine did not clear the infection, and after 10 days the parasite load approached that of control bees. Moreover, when pathogens were exposed to the alkaloid prior to host ingestion, the protozoan’s viability was not directly affected, suggesting that anti-parasite effects were relatively weak. Nicotine consumption in a single dose did not impose any cost even in starved bees but the alkaloid had detrimental effects on healthy bees if consistently consumed for weeks. These toxic effects disappeared in infected bees, suggesting that detoxification costs might have been counterbalanced by the advantages in slowing the progression of the infection. Nicotine consumption did not affect bee lifespan but the reduction in the parasite load may have other likely unexplored subtle benefits both for individual bees and their colony.  Potential evidence for self-medication is discussed.

The prediction that workers with higher reproductive potential in the unmatched groups would show less aggression overall, compared to those in the matched groups, was not borne out. Nonetheless, butting frequency by the worker with developed ovaries was significantly reduced, as was oophagy, whereas the butting frequency by the worker with undeveloped ovaries was significantly increased.

In this area, parasitism of Bombus terrestris by S. bombi is common but does not affect every queen; therefore, as summer begins, B. terrestris queens continue to dominate some flower patches and disappear from others. At sites dominated by parasitized queens, we found that the nectar standing crop of red clover was smaller, B. terrestris workers carried out fewer legitimate visits to red clover and more nectar robberies, and the workers were smaller than at other sites. Removing queens from a site increased the nectar standing crop of red clover, the frequency of worker visits to red clover, and the size of the workers.

Physiological changes during diapause are largely conserved across species and are hypothesized to be regulated by a conserved suite of genes (a ‘toolkit’). Furthermore, it is hypothesized that in social insects, this toolkit was co‐opted to mediate caste differentiation between long‐lived, reproductive, diapause‐capable queens and short‐lived, sterile workers. Using Bombus terrestris queens, we examined the physiological and transcriptomic changes associated with diapause and CO2 treatment, which causes queens to bypass diapause. We performed comparative analyses with genes previously identified to be associated with diapause in the Dipteran Sarcophaga crassipalpis and with caste differentiation in bumble bees. As in Diptera, diapause in bumble bees is associated with physiological and transcriptional changes related to nutrient storage, stress resistance and core metabolic pathways. There is a significant overlap, both at the level of transcript and gene ontology, between the genetic mechanisms mediating diapause in B. terrestris and S. crassipalpis, reaffirming the existence of a conserved insect diapause genetic toolkit. However, a substantial proportion (10%) of the differentially regulated transcripts in diapausing queens have no clear orthologs in other species, and key players regulating diapause in Diptera (juvenile hormone and vitellogenin) appear to have distinct functions in bumble bees. We also found a substantial overlap between genes related to caste determination and diapause in bumble bees. Thus, our studies demonstrate an intriguing interplay between pathways underpinning adaptation to environmental extremes and the evolution of sociality in insects.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1365-294X\", \"ISSN: 0962-1083\", \"EISSN: 1365-294X\", \"PMID: 26453894\", \"DOI: 10.1111/mec.13410\"]}\n",

Experiments were undertaken under controlled conditions using bumblebees caught foraging on the flowers of two different host plants each of which is known to harbor predominantly one of the two yeasts. Bumblebees were used as sources of inocula to obtain two groups of samples from the nectar of Helleborus foetidus L.

Metschnikowia gruessii was poorly represented in nectar samples, while M. reukaufii was by far the most common and had the highest cell density. Although the two yeasts caused relatively similar changes in nectar sugar composition, which involved increasing fructose and decreasing sucrose proportions, they marginally differed in their quantitative impact on total nectar sugar concentration.

These short and fast yaw turns (\\\"saccades\\\") are usually accompanied by even faster head yaw turns that change gaze direction. Since a large part of image rotation is thereby reduced to brief instants of time, this behavioural pattern facilitates depth perception from visual motion parallax during the intersaccadic intervals. The detailed analysis of the fine structure of the bees' head turning movements shows that the time course of single head saccades is very stereotypical. We find a consistent relationship between the duration, peak velocity and amplitude of saccadic head movements, which in its main characteristics resembles the so-called \\\"saccadic main sequence\\\" in humans. The fact that bumblebee head saccades are highly stereotyped as in humans, may hint at a common principle, where fast and precise motor control is used to reliably reduce the time during which the retinal images moves.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 26352836\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0135020\"]}\n",

Stimulation with IMD, TMX and CLO neither elicited spiking responses from gustatory neurons in the bees’ mouthparts, nor inhibited the responses of sucrose-sensitive neurons. Our data indicate that bees cannot taste neonicotinoids and are not repelled by them. Instead, bees preferred solutions containing IMD or TMX, even though the consumption of these pesticides caused them to eat less food overall. This work shows that bees cannot control their exposure to neonicotinoids in food and implies that treating flowering crops with IMD and TMX presents a sizeable hazard to foraging bees.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 25901684\", \"EISSN: 1476-4687\", \"DOI: 10.1038/nature14414\", \"ISSN: 0028-0836\", \"CODEN: NATUAS\"]}\n",

Despite this threat, few studies have investigated the life‐history responses of pollinators to experimentally controlled changes in temperature, which should be especially informative for species with complex life histories such as eusocial insects.\\nThis study uses the key pollinator Bombus terrestris, a eusocial bumblebee with an annual colony cycle, to determine how temperature affects life‐history traits at both individual and colony levels.\\nIn two laboratory experiments, we reared B. terrestris colonies at either 20 or 25 °C, and measured differences in a set of life‐history traits including colony longevity, queen longevity, worker longevity, production of workers, production of sexuals (queen and male production) and growth schedule, as well as effects on thermoregulatory behaviours.\\nHigher rearing temperature had a significant positive effect on colony longevity in one of the two experiments but no significant effects on queen or worker longevity. Higher rearing temperature significantly increased colony size but did not affect the timing of peak colony size. It was also associated with significantly higher queen production but had no effect on the production of workers or males or the timing of male production. Higher temperature colonies exhibited significantly more wing fanning by workers and significantly less wax canopy construction. Hence, an increase in rearing temperature of a few degrees increased colony longevity, colony size and queen production. However, individual longevity was not affected and so may have been buffered by changes in costly thermoregulatory behaviours.\\nWe conclude that eusocial insects may show complex phenotypic responses to projected temperature increases under climate change, including effects on productivity and reproduction at the colony level. Such effects should be considered when predicting the impact of climate change on the provision of essential pollination services.\\nLay Summary\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1365-2435\", \"CODEN: FECOE5\", \"ISSN: 0269-8463\", \"EISSN: 1365-2435\", \"DOI: 10.1111/1365-2435.12480\"]}\n",

Bees obtain fat, carbohydrates and protein from pollen and nectar. As both excessive and deficient amounts of these macronutrients are detrimental, bees would benefit from assessing food quality to guarantee an optimal nutrient supply. While bees can detect sucrose and use it to assess nectar quality, it is unknown whether they can assess the macronutrient content of pollen. Previous studies have shown that bees preferentially collect pollen of higher protein content, suggesting that differences in pollen quality can be detected either by individual bees or via feedback from larvae. In this study, we examined whether and, if so, how individuals of the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) discriminate between different concentrations of pollen and casein mixtures and thus nutrients. Bumblebees were trained using absolute and differential conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER). As cues related to nutrient concentration could theoretically be perceived by either smell or taste, bees were tested on both olfactory and, for the first time, chemotactile perception. Using olfactory cues, bumblebees learned and discriminated between different pollen types and casein, but were unable to discriminate between different concentrations of these substances. However, when they touched the substances with their antennae, using chemotactile cues, they could also discriminate between different concentrations. Bumblebees are therefore able to discriminate between foods of different concentrations using contact chemosensory perception (taste). This ability may enable them to individually regulate the nutrient intake of their colonies.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.118554\", \"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\", \"PMID: 26202778\"]}\n",

In bumblebees (Bombus terrestris), pentacosane (C25) was suggested to serve as a queen pheromone. Here, we repeat these studies using a different species of bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) with a more controlled experimental design. Instead of dequeened colonies, we used same-aged, three-worker queenless groups comprising either experienced or naive workers (with/without adult exposure to queen pheromone). We quantified three hydrocarbons (C23, C25 and C27) on the cuticular surfaces of females and tested their effects on the two worker types. Our results indicate differences in responses of naive and experienced workers, genetic effects on worker reproduction, and general effects of hydrocarbons and duration of egg laying on ovary resorption rates.

Using experimental inoculations of five trypanosomatid strains into groups of its natural host, the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, we investigate the effects of the initial parasite strain distribution across group members on the establishment and transmission success of the different strains to new hosts. For a given number of parasite strains circulating within a host group, transmission to new hosts was increased when the strains were initially inoculated as mixed infections (as opposed to separate single infections), presumably because mixed infections generally favored fast replicating strains. In contrast, separate single infections reduced transmission at least in part through a precedence effect, whereby weak strains appeared to persist by making their host unavailable to superinfection.

We found a positive association between reward amount (nectar sugar and pollen) and the floral scent compound phenylacetaldehyde.

When foraging on artificial flowers scented with synthetic volatiles, bumble bees developed a preference for those specific compounds that honestly indicated reward status.

However, when loaded in bending they are prone to failure by buckling. It is difficult to predict the loading conditions which cause buckling, especially for tubes whose cross sections are not simple shapes. Insights into buckling prevention might be gained by studying this phenomenon in the exoskeletons of insects and other arthropods. We investigated the leg segments (tibiae) of five different insects: the locust (Schistocerca gergaria), American cockroach (Periplaneta americana), death's head cockroach (Blaberus discoidalis), stick insect (Parapachymorpha zomproi) and bumblebee (Bombus terrestris audax). These were tested to failure in cantilever bending and modelled using finite element analysis (FEA). The tibiae of the locust and the cockroaches were found to be approximately circular in shape. Their buckling loads were well predicted by linear elastic FEA, and also by one of the analytical solutions available in the literature for elastic buckling. The legs of the stick insect are also circular in cross section but have several prominent longitudinal ridges. We hypothesised that these ridges might protect the legs against buckling but we found that this was not the case: the loads necessary for elastic buckling were not reached in practice because yield occurred in the material, causing plastic buckling. The legs of bees have a non-circular cross section due to a pollen-carrying feature (the corbicula). We found that this did not significantly affect their resistance to buckling. Our results imply that buckling is the dominant failure mode in the tibia of insects; it likely to be a significant consideration for other arthropods and any organisms with stiff exoskeletons. The interactions displayed here between material properties and cross sectional geometry may provide insights for the biomimetic design of engineering structures using thin walled tubes.\", \"identifier\": [\"CODEN: BBIICI\", \"ISSN: 1748-3182\", \"ISSN: 1748-3190\", \"EISSN: 1748-3190\", \"PMID: 26678374\", \"DOI: 10.1088/1748-3190/11/1/016003\"]}\n",

Their contribution to this essential ecosystem service has been threatened over recent decades by changes in land use, which have led to declines in their populations. In order to design effective conservation measures it is important to understand the effects of variation in landscape composition and structure on the foraging activities of worker bumblebees. This is because the viability of individual colonies is likely to be affected by the trade-off between the energetic costs of foraging over greater distances and the potential gains from access to additional resources.\\nWe used field surveys, molecular genetics and fine resolution remote sensing to estimate the locations of wild bumblebee nests and to infer foraging distances across a 20 km2 agricultural landscape in southern England. We investigated five species, including the rare B. ruderatus and ecologically similar but widespread B. hortorum. We compared worker foraging distances between species and examined how variation in landscape composition and structure affected foraging distances at the colony level.\\nMean worker foraging distances differed significantly between species. Bombus terrestris, B. lapidarius and B. ruderatus exhibited significantly greater mean foraging distances (551 m, 536 m, 501 m, respectively) than B. hortorum and B. pascuorum (336 m, 272 m, respectively). There was wide variation in worker foraging distances between colonies of the same species, which was in turn strongly influenced by the amount and spatial configuration of available foraging habitats. Shorter foraging distances were found for colonies where the local landscape had high coverage and low fragmentation of semi-natural vegetation, including managed agri-environmental field margins. The strength of relationships between different landscape variables and foraging distance varied between species, for example the strongest relationship for B. ruderatus being with floral cover of preferred forage plants.\\nOur findings suggest that favourable landscape composition and configuration has the potential to minimise foraging distances across a range of bumblebee species. There is thus potential for improvements in the design and implementation of landscape management options, such as agri-environment schemes, aimed at providing foraging habitat for bumblebees and enhancing crop pollination services.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1939-5582\", \"DOI: 10.1890/15-0546.1\", \"ISSN: 1051-0761\"]}\n",

The ability of workers to retain memories of these odours and to orient towards them when they leave the nest affects both foraging efficiency and food yield for the colony. In this study, we added sugar solution containing a floral scent (i.e. training scent) directly to empty honeypots within nests of Bombus impatiens in the absence of all other stimuli normally associated with successful foragers. To assess bee learning and memory, we quantified the effects of (a) the number of exposures to the training scent during conditioning, (b) the number of days elapsed post-conditioning (3 days vs. 6 days) and (c) bee age, on appetitive choice of the training scent relative to an unfamiliar scent. A high proportion of the bees of all ages (i.e. 74–80%) contacted the scented syrup we supplied briefly to colonies, with most contacting it once but some as many as 14 times. Most of the bees that may have experienced the training scent in the hive atmosphere but failed to contact a honeypot containing the scented sucrose solution (i.e. bees for which the training scent was familiar but unrewarded) exhibited no response to either the familiar or unfamiliar scent; the few that responded had no preference for either scent. More frequent contact with the scented sucrose increased the likelihood a bee would respond to the scent subsequently. Bees that contacted the scented nectar 1–4 times during conditioning preferred the rewarded odour when tested 3 days later, but after 6 days their scent choice was random, suggesting they retained no memory of it. In contrast, bees that contacted the scented nectar 5–14 times chose the rewarded odour over an unrewarded odour 23 of 24 times when tested 6 days after exposure. This is the first confirmation of social learning in B. impatiens.

Host species can vary in their suitability for a developing endoparasitoid; in particular, the host immune response, which can suppress egg hatching and larval development, has been hypothesized to be one of the most important determinants of parasitoid host range. In this study, we investigated whether three bumblebee host species (Bombus bimaculatus, Bombus griseocollis, and Bombus impatiens) varied in their suitability for the development of a shared parasitoid, the conopid fly (Conopidae, Diptera) and whether the intensity of host encapsulation response, an insect immune defense against invaders, could predict parasitoid success. When surgically implanted with a nylon filament, B. griseocollis exhibited a stronger immune response than both B. impatiens and B. bimaculatus. Similarly, B. griseocollis was more likely to melanize conopid larvae from natural infections and more likely to kill conopids prior to its own death. Our results indicate that variation in the strength of the general immune response of insects may have ecological implications for sympatric species that share parasites. We suggest that, in this system, selection for a stronger immune response may be heightened by the pattern of phenological overlap between local host species and the population peak of their most prominent parasitoid.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1432-1939\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s00442-015-3292-8\", \"ISSN: 0029-8549\", \"PMID: 25795253\"]}\n",

We aimed to investigate the influence of habitat and climate specializations on bumblebee distribution trends over time using long‐term species data. LOCATION: Our study is based on data from the UK and Ireland, for which the most comprehensive set of bumblebee records exists. Previous analysis of the UK data highlighted severe range contractions for a number of species by the 1980s. METHODS: We use the most current dataset to quantify the extent of range change over three time periods (pre‐1960, 1960–80 and 1981–2012) and to investigate whether species are becoming more marginal, that is occupying areas with more extreme or specialized climatic conditions within the UK and Ireland. For species that have contracted or become more marginal, we predict their climatic specialization within the UK and Ireland using Maxent models, allowing us to associate records with climatic suitability values for each time period and to investigate whether or not species are contracting towards their climatic optimum. RESULTS: We find that populations of most rare bumblebee species appear to have stabilized post‐1980, while the more common species appear to have expanded in range. However, rare species tend to have become more marginal in the sites they occupy post‐1980, some have contracted towards their predicted climatic optimum and some of which also retracted towards coastal areas. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a mixed picture of the state of the UK and Ireland's bumblebee fauna, and must be interpreted with caution as changing patterns of recorder effort may distort real trends. They highlight the need for future monitoring of the abundance of pollinators on both a regional and global scale.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1111/ddi.12344\", \"EISSN: 1472-4642\", \"ISSN: 1366-9516\", \"ISSN: 1472-4642\"]}\n",

We found that bumblebees learn to prefer large artificial flowers when they are more rewarding than small ones while ignoring flower size when it does not provide information about floral rewards. However, the bees do not prefer an artificial flower type that gives them information about floral rewards over one that does not.In many plant species, larger flowers offer larger or higher quality rewards to visitors, and flower visitors preferentially visit these larger, more rewarding flowers. Limited evidence suggests that plants in which flower size provides more reliable information about reward value have higher reproductive success than plants in which flower size offers less reliable information. We tested whether bumblebees could learn to respond to flower size when it was an informative reward cue while simultaneously learning not to respond to it when it was not informative. We also tested whether bees would develop a preference for a flower type that provided reward cues over one that did not. Bees were allowed to forage on an artificial array containing 2 flower types, each with a unique color and scent. In the informative flower type, large flowers contained sucrose rewards, whereas small flowers contained quinine solution (a deterrent). In the uninformative flower type, both flower sizes were equally likely to contain sucrose or quinine. Bees learned to prefer large flowers in the informative flower type and to be indifferent to flower size in the uninformative type. However, contrary to expectations, bees did not develop a preference for the informative type. These results suggest that although bees may benefit from floral cues that give information about rewards, plants offering these cues may not receive more flower visits than plants that do not.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1045-2249\", \"ISSN: 1465-7279\", \"DOI: 10.1093/beheco/arv061\", \"EISSN: 1465-7279\"]}\n",

This study aims to attain a detailed understanding of the current and ongoing risk of emerging infectious disease (EID) transmission between managed and wild pollinator species across a wide range of RNA viruses. 3. Within a structured large-scale national survey across 26 independent sites, we quantify the prevalence and pathogen loads of multiple RNA viruses in co-occurring managed honeybee (Apis mellifera) and wild bumblebee (Bombus spp.) populations. We then construct models that compare virus prevalence between wild and managed pollinators. 4. Multiple RNA viruses associated with honeybees are widespread in sympatric wild bumblebee populations. Virus prevalence in honeybees is a significant predictor of virus prevalence in bumblebees, but we remain cautious in speculating over the principle direction of pathogen transmission. We demonstrate species-specific differences in prevalence, indicating significant variation in disease susceptibility or tolerance. Pathogen loads within individual bumblebees may be high and in the case of at least one RNA virus, prevalence is higher in wild bumblebees than in managed honeybee populations. 5. Our findings indicate widespread transmission of RNA viruses between managed and wild bee pollinators, pointing to an interconnected network of potential disease pressures within and among pollinator species.

In eusocial insects, the number of organisms and their body sizes can affect the fitness of the colony. Large‐than‐average body sizes as well as more individuals can improve a colony's thermoregulation, foraging efficiency, and fecundity. However, in bumblebees, large colonies and large body sizes depend largely on high temperatures and a large amount of food resources. Bumblebee taxa can be found in temperate and tropical regions of the world and differ markedly in their colony sizes and body sizes. Variation in colony size and body size may be explained by the costs and benefits associated with the evolutionary history of each species in a particular environment. In this study, we explored the effect of temperature and precipitation (the latter was used as an indirect indicator of food availability) on the colony and body size of twenty‐one bumblebee taxa. A comparative analysis controlling for phylogenetic effects as well as for the body size of queens, workers, and males in bumblebee taxa from temperate and tropical regions indicated that both temperature and precipitation affect colony and body size. We found a negative association between colony size and the rainiest trimester, and a positive association between the colony size and the warmest month of the year. In addition, male bumblebees tend to evolve larger body sizes in places where the rain occurs mostly in the summer and the overall temperature is warmer. Moreover, we found a negative relationship between colony size and body sizes of queens, workers, and males, suggesting potential trade‐offs in the evolution of bumblebee colony and body size.\\nWe evaluated the effect of temperature and precipitation on the colony and body sizes of twenty‐one bumblebee taxa using phylogenetic comparative methods.

Here, two western, Bombus huntii Greene and Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski, and one eastern species, Bombus impatiens Cresson, are compared for their efficacy as pollinators of greenhouse-grown tomatoes. In two experiments, colonies were placed in greenhouses and compared with control plants that received no supplemental pollination. In the first experiment, seed set was significantly increased with B. huntii pollination in one variety of cherry tomatoes. In the second experiment comparing all three bumble bee species, fruit weight was an average of 25.2 g heavier per fruit pollinated by bees versus the control, and the number of days to harvest was 2.9 d shorter for bee-pollinated fruit. In some rounds of pollination, differences were found among bumble bee species, but these were inconsistent across replicates and not statistically significant overall. Additionally, fruit weight was shown to be highly correlated to fruit diameter and seed set in all tests and, thus, is shown to be a reliable metric for assessing pollination in future studies. These results suggest that commercialization of western bumble bees is a viable alternative to the current practices of moving of nonnative bees into western North America to pollinate tomatoes.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1938-291X\", \"ISSN: 0022-0493\", \"DOI: 10.1093/jee/tov078\", \"PMID: 26470206\", \"EISSN: 1938-291X\"]}\n",

We found that bees readily learned multiple reward–colour associations, and when presented with novel floral targets generalized to colours similar to those trained for each reward type. These results expand the ecological significance of work on bee learning and raise new questions regarding the cognitive ecology of pollination.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1744-957X\", \"EISSN: 1744-957X\", \"ISSN: 1744-9561\", \"PMID: 26423070\", \"DOI: 10.1098/rsbl.2015.0628\"]}\n",

A test was made to determine whether a differential preference for flower colour, with bumble-bees preferring blue and hawkmoths white flowers, could explain the variation in flower colour. Whether a single pollinator could maintain a flower colour polymorphism was examined by testing to see if preference for a flower colour varied between day and dusk for hawkmoths and whether bumble-bees preferred novel or rare flower colour morphs.\\nHawkmoths preferred blue flowers under both day and dusk light conditions. Naïve bumble-bees preferred blue flowers but quickly learned to forage randomly on the two colour morphs when similar rewards were presented in the flowers. Bees quickly learned to associate a flower colour with a pollen reward. Prior experience affected the choice of flower colour by bees, but they did not preferentially visit novel flower colours or rare or common colour morphs.\\nDifferences in flower colour preference between the two major pollinators could not explain the variation in flower colour observed in A. coerulea. The preference of hawkmoths for flower colour did not change between day and dusk, and bumble-bees did not prefer a novel or a rare flower colour morph.

Although bees exposed to acute doses showed conditioned responses less frequently than controls, we found no difference in the number of individuals able to learn at field-realistic exposure levels.

Nicotine consumption in a single dose did not impose any cost even in food-stressed bees (starved) but the alkaloid had detrimental effects on healthy bees if consistently consumed for weeks. These toxic effects disappeared in infected bees suggesting that detoxification costs might have been counterbalanced by the advantages in slowing the progression of the infection. Nonetheless we did not find a benefit of nicotine consumption in terms of life expectancy of infected bees, making these findings difficult to interpret. Our results indicate that caution is warranted in interpreting impacts of plant metabolites on insect parasites and suggest that the conditions under which nicotine consumption provides benefits to either bees or plants remain to be identified. The contention that secondary metabolites in nectar may be under selection from pollinators, or used by plants to enhance their own reproductive success, remains to be confirmed.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 2046-1402\", \"DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.6262.1\", \"ISSN: 2046-1402\"]}\n",

This two-year study focused on establishing whether bumble bees living and foraging in agricultural areas using neonicotinoid crop protection show early biochemical signs of intoxication. Bumble bee colonies (\\nBombus impatiens\\n) were placed in two different agricultural cropping areas: 1) control (≥3 km from fields planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds) or 2) exposed (within 500 m of fields planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds) and maintained for the duration of corn sowing. As determined by Real Time qPCR, AChE mRNA expression was initially significantly higher in bumble bees from exposed sites, then decreased throughout the planting season to reach a similar endpoint to that of bumble bees from control sites.

They are thought to increase the attractiveness over long distances and to direct nearby pollinators toward the rewarding flowers. In Tibouchina pulchra, a massively flowering tree, the whole flower changes its color during anthesis. On the first day, the flowers are white and on the next 3 days, they change to pink. This creates a new large-scale color pattern in which the white pre-changed flowers contrast against the pink post-changed ones over the entire tree. We describe the spectral characteristics of floral colors of T. pulchra and test bumblebees' response to this color pattern when viewed at different angles (simulating long and short distances). The results indicated the role of different color components in bumblebee attraction and the possible scenario in which this flower color pattern has evolved. We tested bumblebees' preference for simulated trees with 75% pink and 25% white flowers resembling the color patterns of T. pulchra, and trees with green leaves and pink flowers (control) in long-distance approach. We also compared an artificial setting with three pink flowers and one white flower (T. pulchra model) against four pink flowers with white floral guides (control) in short-distance approach. Bumblebees spontaneously preferred the simulated T. pulchra patterns in both approaches despite similar reward. Moreover, in short distances, pollinator visits to peripheral, non-rewarding flowers occurred only half as frequently in the simulated T. pulchra when compared to the control. Thefore, this exceptional floral color change and the retention of old flowers in T. pulchra favors the attraction of pollinators over long distances in a deception process while it honestly directs them toward the rewarding flowers at short distances possibly exploring their innate color preferences.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1664-462X\", \"EISSN: 1664-462X\", \"DOI: 10.3389/fpls.2015.00362\", \"PMID: 26052335\"]}\n",

Detailed epidemiological studies would improve our knowledge of the survival, spread and establishment of the pest. Movement of an infested hive could spread SHB rapidly over large distances. Modelling of SHB spread in absence of movement of hives, suggests that natural spread of the beetle alone will take more than hundred years to reach Abruzzo from Calabria (around 250 km). A model considering the ownership of multiple apiaries per beekeeper indicates that spread would be 10 times faster. Opportunity maps indicate that, once introduced, the SHB could complete its life cycle in all EU Member States between May and September. It is recommended that restrictions on the movement of honey bees, bumblebees and commodities from infested to non‐infested areas be maintained until SHB is eradicated, to prevent spread of the pest. Strengthening visual inspection, preventing infestation using a fine mesh and issuing a health certificate for intra‐EU trade of queen bees, within 24 hours before dispatch, could reduce the risk of SHB transmission via consignments. In general, visual inspection of the beehive, as described in this document, is the preferred method of detecting SHB. Traps could help to detect and reduce SHB infestation levels. Maintaining good honey house hygiene and good beekeeping practices are the most important measures to control SHB where eradication is no longer the objective, given that no approved veterinary medicine is available in the EU. A field experiment found natural infestation of commercial bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) colonies placed next to SHB‐infested honey bee hives. However, there are no data published on SHB infestation in natural bumblebee colonies.

In the present study, we investigated in a comparative approach the visual and olfactory floral cues of six Campanula species, of which only Campanula lactiflora has never been reported as a pollen source of the oligolectic bee Ch. rapunculi. We hypothesized that the flowers of Campanula species visited by Ch. rapunculi share visual (i.e. color) and/or olfactory cues (scents) that give them a host-specific signature. To test this hypothesis, floral color and scent were studied by spectrophotometric and chemical analyses, respectively. Additionally, we performed bioassays within a flight cage to test the innate color preference of Ch. rapunculi. Our results show that Campanula flowers reflect the light predominantly in the UV-blue/blue bee-color space and that Ch. rapunculi displays a strong innate preference for these two colors. Furthermore, we recorded spiroacetals in the floral scent of all Campanula species, but Ca. lactiflora. Spiroacetals, rarely found as floral scent constituents but quite common among Campanula species, were recently shown to play a key function for host-flower recognition by Ch. rapunculi. We conclude that Campanula species share some visual and olfactory floral cues, and that neurological adaptations (i.e. vision and olfaction) of Ch. rapunculi innately drive their foraging flights toward host flowers.

Fast‐evolving RNA viruses, known to cause severe colony losses in managed honeybee populations, deserve particular attention for their propensity to jump between host species and thus threaten ecologically and economically important wild pollinator communities. We review the literature on pollinator viruses to identify biological and anthropogenic drivers of disease emergence, highlight gaps in the literature, and discuss potential management strategies. We provide evidence that many wild pollinator species are exposed to viruses from commercial species, resulting in multiple spillover events. However, it is not clear whether species become infected as a result of spillover or whether transmission is occurring within these wild populations. Ecological traits of pollinating insects, such as overlapping ranges, niches and behaviours, clearly promote cross‐species transmission of RNA viruses. Moreover, we conclude that the social behaviour and phylogenetic relatedness of social pollinators further facilitate within‐ and between‐host transmission, leaving these species particularly vulnerable to emerging diseases. We argue that the commercial use of pollinators is a key driver of disease emergence in these beneficial insects and that this must be addressed by management and policy. Synthesis and applications. There are important knowledge gaps, ranging from disease distribution and prevalence, to pathogen life history and virulence, to the impacts of disease emergence, which need to be addressed as research priorities. It is clear that avoiding anthropogenic pathogen spillover is crucial to preventing and managing disease emergence in pollinators, with far‐reaching effects on our food security, ecosystem services and biodiversity.

Queens communicate their status through chemical signals, and the responses of workers to these signals include the suppression of ovarian activation. In most species of primitively social insects, dominant individuals indicate their status through aggressive behaviour, which also inhibits reproduction in workers. In some species, which lack queen–worker dimorphism, chemical signalling may act synergistically with agonistic interactions to establish the division of labour between females. Here, we investigated which mechanisms are involved in reproductive regulation in the orchid bee Euglossa melanotricha. Our long-term observations showed that dominant females monopolized egg laying and were able to recognize the eggs of subordinates. The overt aggression towards subordinates affected the egg-laying behaviour of these females but did not inhibit their ovarian development. We found that dominants maintained their monopoly on reproduction even after their experimental removal. When subordinates were removed, the productivity of the nest was reduced significantly, indicating clear benefits of the division of labour between females. We then analysed the chemical cuticular profile of the females and found that variation in the composition of hydrocarbons reflected the social status of the different individuals. The results of this study suggest that chemical signals evolved as honest signals and that workers restrain themselves from reproducing.

Lysimachia arvensis is a polymorphic species with red and blue flowers, red colour being genetically dominant. Both morphs show differences in fitness due to climatic factors, and the blue performs better in xeric Mediterranean environments where red-flowered plants persist in low proportion. Although the role of abiotic factors as selective agent has been studied, the selection mediated by pollinators has still not been considered. Experimental manipulations of morph frequencies were made to measure the effect of flower colour on pollinator visitation. Moreover, selection analyses on both male and female fitness were used in three populations with different morph proportions. Blue flowers are perceived by pollinators as UV-blue while red flowers are perceived as UV, but the contrast between blue flowers and the background is stronger than that of red flowers. Solitary bees were the main pollinators and exerted phenotypic selection on flower colour (quantified by bee vision) but not on flower size. Blue flowers were visited at a higher rate than expected, based on their frequency in populations. In the three populations studied, male success was markedly higher in the blue morph but colour had no consistent effect on female success. We found strong directional phenotypic selection for blue flowers through male function in the two blue-biased populations, and through female function only in the most blue-biased population. Therefore, in Mediterranean areas, not only is the blue morph favoured by climatic factors, but it is also selected by pollinators. Thus, selection by pollinators or climatic factors does not explain the maintenance of red flowered plants in Mediterranean areas. The delayed selfing mechanism of L. arvensis could offer reproductive assurance when outcross pollen is limited, mitigating the effects of both biotic and abiotic selective agents and protecting the red morph.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1618-0437\", \"ISSN: 1433-8319\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.ppees.2015.01.004\"]}\n",

Plants flowering in distinct habitats like grasslands and forests present their flowers in very different light environments and against different backgrounds. Since most Angiosperms depend on or profit from pollination by animals, plants may exhibit flower colours that are most conspicuous when seen in the predominant illumination or against the predominant background colour of their environment. To compare flower colours of different habitats, we collected flower reflectance spectra of 239 herbs from forest and grassland sites in three German regions. We compared chromatic and achromatic components of flower colours from the honeybee’s point of view as well as in principal component analysis (PCA) to exclude the bias of particular visual systems. Our results show that flower colours do not differ between closed forest and open grassland habitats in any chromatic or achromatic aspect both from the bee’s perspective and without any model bias (PCA). Thus, although the colours of lights and backgrounds are different between both types of habitats, we find no evidence of an adaptation of flower colours to the visual system of bees. The finding that flower colours look similar for bees in different environments may be related to a mechanism called colour constancy which allows bees and other pollinator species to compensate for varying illumination conditions.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1872-8847\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s11829-015-9369-9\", \"ISSN: 1872-8855\"]}\n",

Bumblebees provide a useful model system to explore how different lifestyles are reflected in learning abilities, because their (female but sterile) workers and males engage in fundamentally different behaviour routines. Bumblebee males, like workers, embark on active flower foraging but in contrast to workers they have to trade off their feeding with mate search, potentially affecting their abilities to learn and utilize floral cues efficiently during foraging. We used a serial colour-learning task with freely flying males and workers to compare their ability to flexibly learn visual floral cues with reward in a foraging scenario that changed over time. Male bumblebees did not differ from workers in both their learning speed and their ability to overcome previously acquired associations, when these ceased to predict reward. In all foraging tasks we found a significant improvement in choice accuracy in both sexes over the course of the training. In both sexes, the characteristics of the foraging performance depended largely on the colour difference of the two presented feeder types. Large colour distances entailed fast and reliable learning of the rewarding feeders whereas choice accuracy on highly similar colours improved significantly more slowly. Conversely, switching from a learned feeder type to a novel one was fastest for similar feeder colours and slow for highly different ones.

We discuss the possible drivers and limitations shaping the foraging abilities of males and workers and implications for pollination ecology.

The ability of workers to survive winter conditions is seen as the primary barrier to establishment, given the year-round colony activity of this sub-species. We use standardised cold tolerance indices as outlined by the EU policy support action ‘REBECA’ as well as assessing rapid cold hardening (RCH) ability. Cold tolerance was comparable to that of the UK-native Bombus terrestris audax, including a strong RCH response.

In bumblebees the division of labor is related to body size; relatively small workers are more likely to stay inside the nest and tend (“nurse”) brood, whereas their larger sisters are more likely to forage. Despite their ecological and economic importance, very little is known about the endocrine regulation of division of labor in bumblebees. We studied the influence of juvenile hormone (JH) on task performance in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We first used a radioimmunoassay to measure circulating JH titers in workers specializing in nursing and foraging activities. Next, we developed new protocols for manipulating JH titers by combining a size-adjusted topical treatment with the allatotoxin Precocene-I and replacement therapy with JH-III. Finally, we used this protocol to test the influence of JH on task performance. JH levels were either similar for nurses and foragers (three colonies), or higher in nurses (two colonies). Nurses had better developed ovaries and JH levels were typically positively correlated with ovarian state. Manipulation of JH titers influenced ovarian development and wax secretion, consistent with earlier allatectomy studies. These manipulations however, did not affect nursing or foraging activity, or the likelihood to specialize in nursing or foraging activity. These findings contrast with honeybees in which JH influences age-related division of labor but not adult female fertility. Thus, the evolution of complex societies in bees was associated with modifications in the way JH influences social behavior.\\n•We develop a non-invasive method to pharmacologically manipulate JH titers in bees.•We show that JH influences oogenesis but not task performance in a bumblebee.•JH influences different social behaviors in bumblebees and honeybees.•Eusocial evolution in bees was associated with modifications in JH signaling.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2016.08.004\", \"EISSN: 1095-6867\", \"ISSN: 0018-506X\", \"PMID: 27503109\"]}\n",

In addition, the neogregarine Apicystis bombi has been discovered to be more prevalent than previously thought. Here, we assess for the first time the lethal and sublethal effects of these parasites during single and mixed infections of worker bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Fifteen days after experimental exposure, 22% of bees exposed to A. bombi, 50% of bees exposed to DWV and 86% of bees exposed to both parasites had died. Bumblebees that had ingested A. bombi had increased sucrose sensitivity (SS) and a lower lipid:body size ratio than control bees. While dual infected bumblebees showed no increase in SS.

Therefore, in this report, we comprehensively analyzed the response of the siRNA pathway in bumblebees of Bombus terrestris to systemic infections of the virulent Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) and the avirulent slow bee paralysis virus (SBPV). Our results showed that IAPV and SBPV infections induced the expression of Dicer-2. IAPV infections also triggered the production of predominantly 22 nt-long virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs). Intriguingly, these 22 nt-long vsiRNAs showed a high proportion of antigenomic IAPV sequences. Conversely, these predominantly 22 nt-long vsiRNAs of SBPV were not detected in SBPV infected bees. Furthermore, an “RNAi-of-RNAi” experiment on Dicer-2 did not result in altered genome copy numbers of IAPV (n = 17–18) and also not of SBPV (n = 11–12). Based on these results, we can speculate about the importance of the siRNA pathway in bumblebees for the antiviral response. During infection of IAPV, this pathway is probably recruited but it might be insufficient to control viral infection in our experimental setup. The host can control SBPV infection, but aside from the induction of Dicer-2 expression, no further evidence of the antiviral activity of the siRNA pathway was observed. This report may also enhance the current understanding of the siRNA pathway in the innate immunity of non-model insects upon different viral infections.\\n[Display omitted]\\n•IAPV and SBPV infections induced the expression of Dicer-2.•IAPV infections induced the production of predominantly 22 nt-long virus-derived siRNAs with a strong antigenome polarity.•Lack of evidence of Dicer-2 activity upon SBPV infection, as no dominance of 22-nt, SBPV-derived siRNAs was detected.•An “RNAi of RNAi” experiment on Dicer-2 did not result in altered genome copy numbers of IAPV or SBPV.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.12.006\", \"EISSN: 1879-0240\", \"ISSN: 0965-1748\", \"PMID: 26711439\"]}\n",

In order to test how a reduced mono- and sesquiterpenoid emission affect insect behaviour we inhibited the biochemical pathways towards the production of terpenoids of A. millefolium plants and conducted behavioural choice tests. The inhibition resulted in reduced emission rates of most mono- and sesquiterpenes and thus altered the olfactory phenotype of the flowers.

An example is Salvia with lever-like anthers restricting access to nectar. Though the needed force is generally low, it is largely unknown how far even low forces affect flower preference and foraging behaviour of bees. In the present paper, we introduce a method to measure the response of bees to a force mechanism. We explain the construction of artificial flowers mimicking the lever mechanism of a Salvia flower and the procedure to train honeybees and bumblebees to the models. We document the behaviour of the bees on models without barriers and on those with low forces aiming at the same time to determine the bees’ sensibility for discriminating amongst slightly different flower constructions. Artificial flowers with and without movable levers are constructed to test the effect of a present or absent lever under standardised conditions. Both model types offer sugar syrup (37%) of the same volume. The lever force is 2.8–3.8mN corresponding to the average force in bee-pollinated Salvia species. Choice experiments, five minutes each, are conducted with single bumblebees (lab, n=40) and honeybees (outdoors, n=40). The animal's behaviour and visitation frequency, handling time and flight time between two flower visits are recorded and statistically evaluated. Both bee species can learn to handle the complex artificial flowers. They significantly prefer the model without any barrier indicating that they are able to discriminate amongst models without and with low force demands. The results clearly illustrate that the artificial flowers are suitable for experiments. Continuative choice experiments with reciprocal models of nectar concentration and force will provide a deeper insight into the cost-benefit ratio by bees.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1618-0585\", \"ISSN: 0367-2530\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.flora.2015.12.007\"]}\n",

The alien bumblebee B. terrestris is widely distributed in the temperate forests of Chile, where it is exerting nectar robbing on flowers of F. magellanica. Its geographic distribution and the causes of nectar robbing, however, are currently unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate the distribution of nectar robbing in a wide range of distribution of plants and animals, and the causes of nectar robbing in terms of floral and animal phenotypes, and in terms of animal abundances. The primary nectar robbing did not correlate with the latitude, longitude or altitude of populations, thus indicating an absence of cline variation in the causes of nectar robbing. The variability of primary nectar robbing seemingly showed a bimodal distribution, since the most represented categories were the low and high incidence of primary nectar robbing. Petal length, rather than other flora traits, coupled to the glossa length of animals, played a pivotal role in the probability of flowers to experience nectar robbing.

This ability is well studied in nectar collection but its role in pollen foraging is less well understood. Floral sonication is used by bees to extract pollen from some plant species with anthers which must be vibrated (buzzed) to release pollen. Pollen removal is determined by sonication characteristics including frequency and amplitude, and thus the ability to optimise sonication should allow bees to maximise the pollen collection. We investigated the ability of the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) to modify the frequency and amplitude of their buzzes with increasing experience manipulating flowers of the buzz-pollinated plant Solanum rostratum. We analysed flight and feeding vibrations generated by naïve workers across feeding bouts. Feeding buzzes were of a higher frequency and a lower amplitude than flight buzzes. Both flight and feeding buzzes had reduced amplitudes with increasing number of foraging trips. However, the frequency of their feeding buzzes was reduced significantly more than their flight buzzes as bumblebee workers gained experience manipulating flowers. These results suggest that bumblebees are able to modify the characteristics of their buzzes with experience manipulating buzz-pollinated flowers. We discuss our findings in the context of bumblebee learning, and the current understanding of the optimal sonication characteristics for releasing pollen in buzz-pollinated species.

The cultivation of lulo outside of its native range, for example in European glasshouses, requires the presence of efficient pollinators to enable high fruit set and yield. Until now, the suitability of Bombus terrestris L., native to Europe and commonly used in agriculture, has been untested for this purpose. In this study, the pollen‐collecting behaviour of B. terrestris when visiting lulo flowers was investigated. It was shown that B. terrestris adopted the lulo as a pollen source, and on average visited three flowers per minute, had five buzzing events per stay and foraged for 15 s on a single flower, independently of the previous number of visits and level of bruising to the anthers. The pollination efficiency of five different treatments was evaluated: (i) exclusion of bees, (ii) single and (iii) multiple visits of B. terrestris, (iv) self‐ and (v) cross‐pollination by hand. The results clearly demonstrated that, for fruit set, pollination is crucial. It was also found that lulo flowers can be successfully self‐pollinated, but give 25% fewer fruit set compared with pollination via multiple bumblebee visits, or cross‐pollination by hand. Fruit set, seed set and fruit size were as high with pollination by B. terrestris as with cross‐pollination by hand, indicating that this bumblebee is an appropriate pollinator for lulo. However, B. terrestris was conspicuously less effective when a flower was visited only once. Therefore, when growing lulos commercially, multiple bumblebee visits should be encouraged, but it is likely that the behaviour of B. terrestris would ensure this anyway. Our results indicate that B. terrestris is a suitable and efficient pollinator for the production of lulo fruits.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1439-0418\", \"DOI: 10.1111/jen.12237\", \"ISSN: 0931-2048\"]}\n",

Only a few studies have described the gustatory responses of bees toward toxins in food, and these experiments have mainly used the proboscis extension response on restrained honey bees. Here, a new behavioral assay is presented for measuring the feeding responses of freely-moving, individual worker bumble bees to nutrients and toxins. This assay measures the amount of solution ingested by each bumble bee and identifies how tastants in food influence the microstructure of the feeding behavior.\\nThe solutions are presented in a microcapillary tube to individual bumble bees that have been previously starved for 2-4 hr. The behavior is captured on digital video. The fine structure of the feeding behavior is analyzed by continuously scoring the position of the proboscis (mouthparts) from video recordings using event logging software. The position of the proboscis is defined by three different behavioral categories: (1) proboscis is extended and in contact with the solution, (2) proboscis is extended but not in contact with the solution and (3) proboscis is stowed under the head. Furthermore the speed of the proboscis retracting away from the solution is also estimated.\\nIn the present assay the volume of solution consumed, the number of feeding bouts, the duration of the feeding bouts and the speed of the proboscis retraction after the first contact is used to evaluate the phagostimulatory or the deterrent activity of the compounds tested.\\nThis new taste assay will allow researchers to measure how compounds found in nectar influence the feeding behavior of bees and will also be useful to pollination biologists, toxicologists and neuroethologists studying the bumble bee's taste system.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 27500630\", \"ISSN: 1940-087X\", \"DOI: 10.3791/54233\", \"EISSN: 1940-087X\"]}\n",

We show that species‐level models are less efficient than subspecies‐based SDMs and that risk areas differ considerably between subspecies.

We analyzed the factors determining resource partitioning patterns. B. hypocrita tended to visit flowers with shallow or wide open corollas, such as Rosa rugosa, whereas B. deuteronymus visited flowers with complex or deeper corollas, such as Lathyrus japonicus. Given the wider floral preference of B. terrestris, floral use by the alien bumblebees consistently overlapped with that of native bumblebees. The visitation of B. terrestris to R. rugosa flowers was positively correlated with that of B. hypocrita. These bumblebee species frequently used similar floral resources, in part because of the large overlap in the seasonality of their foraging activity. The visitation frequency of B. deuteronymus to L. japonicus flowers was independent of the visitation frequency of other bumblebee species. The major visitation periods of the bumblebees to L. japonicus flowers reciprocally differed between B. deuteronymus and B. terrestris, suggesting phenological resource partitioning between these species.

We transplanted ‘resistant’ and ‘susceptible’ microbiota into ‘resistant’ and ‘susceptible’ host backgrounds, and studied the activity of the host immune system. We found that bees from different resistance backgrounds receiving a microbiota differed in aspects of their immune response. At the same time, the elicited immune response also depended on the received microbiota's resistance phenotype.

The impacts of these compounds on pollinators are often unknown.\\nWe compared how consumption of grayanotoxin I and III, natural secondary compounds in the nectar of invasive Rhododendron ponticum L., affected three native bee species: a honeybee, (Apis mellifera L.), a solitary mining bee (Andrena carantonica, Pérez) and a bumblebee, (Bombus terrestris, L.).\\nSurvival of the solitary bee and the bumblebee species was not affected by either grayanotoxin, but honeybees were ∼20× more likely to die when fed solutions containing grayanotoxin I. Furthermore, solitary bees were deterred from feeding and exhibited malaise behaviours indicative of sublethal toxicity in response to consumption of grayanotoxin I. In contrast, grayanotoxins did not affect bumblebee survival or behaviour, even when bees were subjected to multiple stressors (parasite infection or food stress).\\nOur experiments suggest that while R. ponticum provides abundant floral nectar, it is only available as a food resource to pollinators that tolerate grayanotoxins. Pollinators whose health is negatively affected by grayanotoxins may experience negative impacts from R. ponticum invasion directly (if they consume R. ponticum nectar) or indirectly (if native floral resources are replaced by R. ponticum).\\nOur study makes a novel comparison of the effects of a natural nectar secondary compound on three pollinator species and clearly demonstrates drastic variation in the responses of different key pollinator taxa to a nectar toxin.

Actually, bees probably have specific nutritional requirements that could shape their floral choices and constraint them in the current context of global change. However, most studies primarily focus on one bumblebee species at a time, making comparative studies scarce. Herein we performed comparative bioassays on three bumblebee species (i.e. Bombus hypnorum, B. pratorum and B. terrestris) fed on three different pollen diets with distinct nutritive content (Cistus, Erica and Salix pollen diets). Micro-colony performance was compared through different developmental and resource collection parameters for understanding the impact of change in pollen diet on different bumblebee species. The evidence suggests that B. terrestris is by far the most competitive species because of its performance compared to the other species, regardless of pollen diet. Our results also highlight a Bombus species effect as pollen diet impacts the micro-colonies in different ways according to the actual bumblebee species. Such interspecific variation in Bombus performance in response to a dietetic change underlines the importance of considering different bumblebee species in mitigation strategies. Such comparative studies are good advice for developing appropriate suites of plant species that can benefit threatened species while supporting stable or expanding ones.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"PMID: 28005943\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0168462\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

Virus infection induces changes in plant volatile emission profiles, and this can make plants more attractive to insect herbivores, such as aphids, that act as viral vectors. However, it is unknown if virus-induced alterations in volatile production affect plant-pollinator interactions. We found that volatiles emitted by cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-infected tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and Arabidopsis thaliana plants altered the foraging behaviour of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Virus-induced quantitative and qualitative changes in blends of volatile organic compounds emitted by tomato plants were identified by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry. Experiments with a CMV mutant unable to express the 2b RNA silencing suppressor protein and with Arabidopsis silencing mutants implicate microRNAs in regulating emission of pollinator-perceivable volatiles. In tomato, CMV infection made plants emit volatiles attractive to bumblebees. Bumblebees pollinate tomato by 'buzzing' (sonicating) the flowers, which releases pollen and enhances self-fertilization and seed production as well as pollen export. Without buzz-pollination, CMV infection decreased seed yield, but when flowers of mock-inoculated and CMV-infected plants were buzz-pollinated, the increased seed yield for CMV-infected plants was similar to that for mock-inoculated plants. Increased pollinator preference can potentially increase plant reproductive success in two ways: i) as female parents, by increasing the probability that ovules are fertilized; ii) as male parents, by increasing pollen export. Mathematical modeling suggested that over a wide range of conditions in the wild, these increases to the number of offspring of infected susceptible plants resulting from increased pollinator preference could outweigh underlying strong selection pressures favoring pathogen resistance, allowing genes for disease susceptibility to persist in plant populations. We speculate that enhanced pollinator service for infected individuals in wild plant populations might provide mutual benefits to the virus and its susceptible hosts.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1553-7366\", \"PMID: 27513727\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005790\", \"ISSN: 1553-7374\", \"EISSN: 1553-7374\"]}\n",

Bumble bee colonies naturally undergo an initial co-operative phase, when only the queen reproduces, and a subsequent competition phase when all colony members compete to produce male offspring. We experimentally induced these distinct phases by manipulating the presence/absence of the queen and assessed changes in sucrose responsiveness and learning performance. We found that nest-based workers upregulated their reproductive potential in queenless colonies, and correspondingly, these bees were more responsive to sucrose than their queenright counterparts, performing better in an olfactory learning task as a result. These findings suggest that differences in ovarian development are responsible for at least some of the remarkable variation in learning performance that can be observed among very closely related members of social insect colonies.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00265-016-2209-9\", \"EISSN: 1432-0762\", \"ISSN: 0340-5443\"]}\n",

However, high honey bee densities may have an impact on local pollen and nectar availability, which in turn may negatively affect other pollinators. This is exacerbated by the ability of honey bees to recruit foragers to highly rewarding flower patches. We measured floral resource consumption in rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris) in 21 plots located at different distances from apiaries in the scrubland of Garraf Natural Park (Barcelona), and related these measures to visitation rates of honey bees, bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) and other pollinators. In the same plots, we measured flower density, and used pan traps to characterize the wild bee community. Flower resource consumption was largely explained by honey bee visitation and marginally by bumblebee visitation. After accounting for flower density, plots close to apiaries had lower wild bee biomass. This was due to a lower abundance of large bee species, those more likely to be affected by honey bee competition. We conclude that honey bees are the main contributors to pollen/nectar consumption of the two main flowering plants in the scrubland, and that at the densities currently occurring in the park (3.5hives/km2) the wild bee community is being affected. Our study supports the hypothesis that high honey bee densities may have an impact on other pollinators via competition for flower resources.\\nWegen des Beitrages der Honigbiene (Apis mellifera) bei der Bestäubung von Wildblumen und Nutzpflanzen wurde die Bienenhaltung traditionell als eine nachhaltige Aktivität angesehen. Indessen können hohe Honigbienendichten Auswirkungen auf die lokale Verfügbarkeit von Nektar und Pollen haben, was wiederum andere Bestäuber negativ beeinflussen könnte. Dies wird verstärkt durch die Fähigkeit der Honigbiene, Sammlerinnen zu lohnenden Sammelstellen zu dirigieren. Im Buschland des Garraf-Naturparks bei Barcelona maßen wir den Verbrauch von Blütenressourcen an Rosmarin (Rosmarinus officinalis) und Thymian (Thymus vulgaris) an 21 Standorten, die unterschiedlich weit von Bienenständen entfernt lagen, und setzten diese Werte in Bezug zu den Besuchsraten von Honigbienen, Hummeln (Bombus terrestris) und sonstigen Bestäubern. An den gleichen Standorten bestimmten wir die Blütendichte und setzten Farbschalen ein, um die Wildbienengemeinschaft zu erfassen. Die Nutzung der Blüt enressou wurde weitgehend durch die Besuchsraten der Honigbiene erklärt und in geringfügigem Maße durch Hummelbesuch. Nach Berücksichtigung der Blütendichte wiesen Standorte in der Nähe von Bienenständen eine geringere Wildbienen-Biomasse auf. Dies war auf eine geringere Abundanz der großen Wildbienenarten zurückzuführen, also der Arten, die wahrscheinlich durch die Konkurrenz der Honigbiene beeinträchtigt werden. Wir schließen, dass Honigbienen den größten Beitrag zum Pollen- bzw. Nektarverbrauch bei den beiden wichtigsten Blütenpflanzen des Gebietes leisten und dass die Wildbienengemeinschaft bei den gegenwärtigen Honigbienendichten im Park (3.5 Völker/km2) beeinflusst wird. Unsere Untersuchung unterstützt die Hypothese, dass hohe Honigbienendichten durch Konkurrenz um Blütenressourcen einen Einfluss auf andere Bestäuber haben könnten.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1439-1791\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.baae.2015.11.004\"]}\n",

Individual foragers from pesticide-exposed colonies carried out longer foraging bouts than untreated controls (68 vs. 55 min). Pesticide-exposed bees also brought back pollen less frequently than controls indicating reduced foraging performance. 4. A higher proportion of bees from pesticide-exposed colonies returned when released 1 km from their nests; this is potentially related to increased orientation experience during longer foraging bouts.

We tested the effect of Ne on the evolutionary rate of an important immune gene for the antimicrobial peptide Hymenoptaecin in two common central European bumblebee species: Bombus terrestris and Bombus lapidarius. Both species are similar in their biology and are expected to be under similar selective pressures because pathogen prevalence does not differ between species.

Estimates of long‐ and short‐term Ne were three‐ to four‐fold higher Ne in B. terrestris, although the species did not differ in census population sizes. The difference in Ne might result in less efficient selection and suboptimal adaptation of immune genes (e.g. hymenoptaecin) in B. lapidarius, and thus this species might become less resistant and more tolerant, turning into a superspreader of diseases.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1095-8312\", \"ISSN: 0024-4066\", \"EISSN: 1095-8312\", \"DOI: 10.1111/bij.12835\"]}\n",

An example is Salvia with lever-like anthers restricting access to nectar. Though the needed force is generally low, it is largely unknown how far even low forces affect flower preference and foraging behaviour of bees. In the present paper, we introduce a method to measure the response of bees to a force mechanism. We explain the construction of artificial flowers mimicking the lever mechanism of a Salvia flower and the procedure to train honeybees and bumblebees to the models. We document the behaviour of the bees on models without barriers and on those with low forces aiming at the same time to determine the beesâ€™ sensibility for discriminating amongst slightly different flower constructions. Artificial flowers with and without movable levers are constructed to test the effect of a present or absent lever under standardised conditions. Both model types offer sugar syrup (37%) of the same volume. The lever force is 2.8â€“3.8mN corresponding to the average force in bee-pollinated Salvia species. Choice experiments, five minutes each, are conducted with single bumblebees (lab, n=40) and honeybees (outdoors, n=40). The animal's behaviour and visitation frequency, handling time and flight time between two flower visits are recorded and statistically evaluated. Both bee species can learn to handle the complex artificial flowers. They significantly prefer the model without any barrier indicating that they are able to discriminate amongst models without and with low force demands.

MP biosynthetic processes in the cephalic part of the bumblebee male labial gland (LG) are of extraordinary complexity, involving enzymes of fatty acid and isoprenoid biosynthesis, which jointly produce more than 50 compounds. We employed a differential transcriptomic approach to identify candidate genes involved in MP biosynthesis by sequencing Bombus terrestris LG and fat body (FB) transcriptomes. We identified 12 454 abundantly expressed gene products (reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads value > 1) that had significant hits in the GenBank nonredundant database. Of these, 876 were upregulated in the LG (> 4‐fold difference). We identified more than 140 candidate genes potentially involved in MP biosynthesis, including esterases, fatty acid reductases, lipases, enzymes involved in limited fatty acid chain shortening, neuropeptide receptors and enzymes involved in biosynthesis of triacylglycerols, isoprenoids and fatty acids. For selected candidates, we confirmed their abundant expression in LG using quantitative real‐time reverse transcription‐PCR (qRT‐PCR). Our study shows that the Bombus terrestris LG transcriptome reflects both fatty acid and isoprenoid MP biosynthetic processes and identifies rational gene targets for future studies to disentangle the molecular basis of MP biosynthesis.

We do, for instance, not yet know whether and how bees assess the nutritional quality of pollen or whether they use information on pollen quality to adjust foraging patterns. In a previous study, we showed that Bombus terrestris workers use their sense of taste to discriminate pollen differing in concentration and, thus, nutrient content. We now investigated whether they translate this ability into foraging behavior by observing microcolonies offered the choice between two feeders containing different pollen types and concentrations and, thus, qualities. We examined whether bumblebees used direct (chemotactile) or indirect (olfactory) cues to assess pollen quality and whether they individually assessed pollen quality or relied on larval feedback. By changing pollen quality after 21 days, we further tested whether information on pollen quality was subsequently associated with other (faster assessable) cues (e.g., odor) or continuously re-assessed. We found that bees always preferred pollen of higher quality and individually assessed quality based on chemotactile cues. Moreover, changing pollen quality resulted in rapid equivalent changes in foraging behavior, even without feedback from larvae. Consequently, individual bumblebee foragers continuously re-assess pollen quality to provide their colonies with high-quality food.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00265-016-2129-8\", \"EISSN: 1432-0762\", \"ISSN: 0340-5443\"]}\n",

Here, we investigate this by characterizing the performance of bumblebees, B. terrestris, landing on a flat platform at two different orientations (horizontal and vertical) and at four different light intensities (ranging from 600 lx down to 19 lx). As light intensity decreased, the bees modified their body position and the distance at which they extended their legs, suggesting that the control of landing in these insects is visually mediated. Nevertheless, the effect of light intensity was small and the landings were still well controlled, even in the dimmest light. We suggest that the changes in landing behavior that occurred in dim light might represent adaptations that allow the bees to perform smooth landings across the broad range of light intensities at which they are active.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.3389/fnbeh.2016.00174\", \"PMID: 27683546\", \"EISSN: 1662-5153\", \"ISSN: 1662-5153\"]}\n",

Functionally, immune priming is comparable to immune memory in vertebrates. Individuals that have survived exposure to a given parasite are better protected against subsequent exposures. Protection may be cross-reactive, but demonstrations of persistent and specific protection in invertebrates are increasing. This immune priming can cross generations (\\\"trans-generational\\\" immune priming), preparing offspring for the prevailing parasite environment. While these phenomena gain increasing support, the mechanistic foundations underlying such immune priming, both within and across generations, remain largely unknown. Using a transcriptomic approach, we show that exposing bumblebee queens with an injection of heat-killed bacteria, known to induce trans-generational immune priming, alters daughter (worker) gene expression. Daughters, even when unexposed themselves, constitutively express a core set of the genes induced upon direct bacterial exposure, including high expression of antimicrobial peptides, a beta-glucan receptor protein implicated in bacterial recognition and the induction of the toll signaling pathway, and slit-3 which is important in honeybee immunity. Maternal exposure results in a distinct upregulation of their daughters' immune system, with a signature overlapping with the induced individual response to a direct exposure. This will mediate mother-offspring protection, but also associated costs related to reconfiguration of constitutive immune expression. Moreover, identification of conserved immune pathways in memory-like responses has important implications for our understanding of the innate immune system, including the innate components in vertebrates, which share many of these pathways.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 27442590\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0159635\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

In contrast, body size in ectothermic invertebrates has been suggested to follow the reverse ecogeographic trend: these converse Bergmann's patterns may be driven by the ecological constraints of shorter season length and lower food availability in cooler high latitude locations. Such patterns are particularly common in large insects due to their longer development times. As large and facultatively endothermic insects, bumblebees could thus be expected to follow either trend. In this investigation, we studied body size of three bumblebee species over a large spatial area and investigated whether interspecific trends in body size correspond to differences in their distribution consistent with either Bergmann's or a converse Bergmann's rule. We examined the body size of queens, males and workers of the Bombus lucorum complex of cryptic bumblebee species from across the whole of Great Britain. We found interspecific differences in body size corresponding to Bergmann's rule: queens and males of the more northerly distributed, cool-adapted, species were largest. In contrast, the mean body size of the worker caste did not vary between the three species.

The system was built using mostly off‐the‐shelf components and has a novel feeding mechanism that uses servos to perform refill operations. We used the robotic system in two separate behavioral studies with bumblebees (Bombus terrestris): The system was used both for training of the bees and for the experimental data collection. The robotic system was reliable, with no flight in our studies failing due to a technical malfunction. The data recorded were easy to apply for further analysis. The software and the hardware design are open source. The development of cheap open‐source prototyping platforms during the recent years has opened up many possibilities in designing of experiments. Automatization not only reduces workload, but also potentially allows experimental designs never done before, such as dynamic experiments, where the system responds to, for example, learning of the animal. We present a complete system with hardware and software, and it can be used as such in various experiments requiring feeders and collection of visitation data. Use of the system is not limited to any particular experimental setup or even species.\\nWe developed a low‐cost automatized feeder/visitation data acquisition system for bumblebees.

Although seed transmission was often suspected, transmission from asymptomatic ornamentals and weeds through pruning tools, or via insect vectors could not be excluded. To evaluate the risk of pospiviroid transmission via insects, three insect spp. commonly observed in these crops were used in multiple transmission experiments with Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), Tomato apical stunt viroid (TASVd), Pepper chat fruit viroid (PCFVd) and Tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid (TCDVd)-infected source plants, such as tomatoes, petunias and peppers. The insect species belong to three different functional groups: a phloem-feeding pest (Myzus persicae Sulzer), a pollinator (Bombus terrestris L.) that feeds on pollen and nectar, and a generalist predator (Macrolophus pygmaeus Rambur), that consumes several species of insect pests and feeds on plant saps and pollen. For each insect, four transmission experiments were conducted in which different receptor host plants were challenged. During the experiments, insects that were seen probing or feeding on were captured and tested for viroids using PCR. The percentage of each insect species that was pospiviroid positive was 100 % for M. persicae, 4 % B. terrestris, and 0 % for M. pygmaeus. Although these results indicate that M. persicae may be a vector, none of the receiving host plants in four separate experiments tested positive. However, transmission by B. terrestris is possible since one of 18 receiving tomato plants tested positive for TCDVd in one of four transmission experiments, resulting in an overall transmission rate of 2.6 %. Based on these results, we believe that the use of pollinating insects and biological control agents in greenhouses does not imply a major phytosanitary risk for viroid dispersal.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1573-8469\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s10658-015-0766-9\", \"ISSN: 0929-1873\"]}\n",

How individuals establish such foraging areas in the presence of other foragers is poorly explored. Here we investigated the foraging patterns of pairs of bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) released sequentially into an 880m2 outdoor flight cage containing 10 feeding stations (artificial flowers). Using motion-sensitive video cameras mounted on flowers, we mapped the flower visitation networks of both foragers, quantified their interactions and compared their foraging success over an entire day. Overall, bees that were released first (residents) travelled 37% faster and collected 77% more nectar, thereby reaching a net energy intake rate 64% higher than bees released second (newcomers). However, this prior-experience advantage decreased as newcomers became familiar with the spatial configuration of the flower array. When both bees visited the same flower simultaneously, the most frequent outcome was for the resident to evict the newcomer. On the rare occasions when newcomers evicted residents, the two bees increased their frequency of return visits to that flower. These competitive interactions led to a significant (if only partial) spatial overlap between the foraging patterns of pairs of bees. While newcomers may initially use social cues (such as olfactory footprints) to exploit flowers used by residents, either because such cues indicate higher rewards and/or safety from predation, residents may attempt to preserve their monopoly over familiar resources through exploitation and interference. We discuss how these interactions may favour spatial partitioning, thereby maximising the foraging efficiency of individuals and colonies.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0150844\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"PMID: 26982030\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

Effects of heat stress on the fertilization of insect-pollinated plants are not well understood, but experiments conducted primarily in self-pollinated crops, such as wheat, show that transfer of fertile pollen may recover yield following stress. We hypothesized that in the partially pollinator-dependent crop, faba bean (Vicia faba L.), insect pollination would elicit similar yield recovery following heat stress. We exposed potted faba bean plants to heat stress for 5 days during floral development and anthesis. Temperature treatments were representative of heat waves projected in the UK for the period 2021–2050 and onwards. Following temperature treatments, plants were distributed in flight cages and either pollinated by domesticated Bombus terrestris colonies or received no insect pollination. Yield loss due to heat stress at 30°C was greater in plants excluded from pollinators (15%) compared to those with bumblebee pollination (2.5%). Thus, the pollinator dependency of faba bean yield was 16% at control temperatures (18–26°C) and extreme stress (34°C), but was 53% following intermediate heat stress at 30°C. These findings provide the first evidence that the pollinator dependency of crops can be modified by heat stress, and suggest that insect pollination may become more important in crop production as the probability of heat waves increases.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1873-2305\", \"PMID: 26989276\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.agee.2015.12.007\", \"ISSN: 1873-2305\", \"ISSN: 0167-8809\"]}\n",

Here, we investigate how large changes in the proximity of nearby surfaces affect optic flow-based flight control strategies. We trained bumblebees to fly along a flight and recorded how the distance between the walls—from 60 cm to 240 cm—affected their flight control. Our results reveal that, as tunnel width increases, both lateral position and ground speed become increasingly variable. We also find that optic flow information from the ground has an increasing influence on flight control, suggesting that bumblebees measure optic flow flexibly over a large lateral and ventral field of view, depending on where the highest magnitude of optic flow occurs. A consequence of this strategy is that, when flying in narrow spaces, bumblebees use optic flow information from the nearby obstacles to control flight, while in more open spaces they rely primarily on optic flow cues from the ground.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00359-015-1055-y\", \"ISSN: 1432-1351\", \"ISSN: 0340-7594\", \"PMID: 26614094\", \"EISSN: 1432-1351\"]}\n",

At the reference site, study fields were drilled with clothianidin-free OSR seeds while at the test site the oilseed rape seeds contained a coating with 10 g clothianidin and 2 g beta-cyfluthrin per kg seeds (Elado®). The comparison of environmental conditions at the study sites indicated that they are as similar as possible in terms of climate, soil, land use, history and current practice of agriculture as well as in availability of oilseed rape and non-crop bee forage. Accordingly, local environmental conditions were considered not to have had any confounding effect on the results of the monitoring of the bee species. Furthermore, the study area was found to be representative for other oilseed rape cultivation regions in Europe.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s10646-016-1724-9\", \"ISSN: 1573-3017\", \"EISSN: 1573-3017\", \"ISSN: 0963-9292\", \"CODEN: ECOTEL\", \"PMID: 27678527\"]}\n",

One of the most debated factors proposed to be contributing to pollinator declines is exposure to pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids, a widely used class of systemic insecticide. Also, newly emerging parasites and diseases, thought to be spread via contact with managed honeybees, may pose threats to other pollinators such as bumblebees. Compared to honeybees, bumblebees could be particularly vulnerable to the effects of stressors due to their smaller and more short-lived colonies. Here, we studied the effect of field-realistic, chronic clothianidin exposure and inoculation with the parasite Nosema ceranae on survival, fecundity, sugar water collection and learning using queenless Bombus terrestris audax microcolonies in the laboratory. Chronic exposure to 1 ppb clothianidin had no significant effects on the traits studied. Interestingly, pesticide exposure in combination with additional stress caused by harnessing bees for Proboscis Extension Response (PER) learning assays, led to an increase in mortality. In contrast to previous findings, the bees did not become infected by N. ceranae after experimental inoculation with the parasite spores, suggesting variability in host resistance or parasite virulence. However, this treatment induced a slight, short-term reduction in sugar water collection, potentially through stimulation of the immune system of the bees. Our results suggest that chronic exposure to 1 ppb clothianidin does not have adverse effects on bumblebee fecundity or learning ability.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 2167-8359\", \"PMID: 27014515\", \"DOI: 10.7717/peerj.1808\", \"EISSN: 2167-8359\"]}\n",

Because of its implications for the evolution of floral traits, whether flower constancy is associated with perceptual stimuli, reward value, and/or flower handling skills has been debated by many authors. However, it remains unknown whether flower handling skill has a substantial influence on flower constancy because flowers that require different handling skills generally also differ in their appearance (i.e., shape). We investigated the foraging type constancy of Bombus terrestris workers that foraged flower patches consisting of two (Trifolium pratense and Trifolium repens) or three (T. pratense, T. repens, and Lotus corniculatus) plant species. In these flower patches, individual bees foraged T. pratense flowers by either one of the two foraging modes that require different foraging techniques (legitimate foraging versus nectar robbing). Behavioral and pollen load analysis indicated that bees sometimes switched their foraging types between legitimate visits to T. pratense and visits to T. repens and between nectar robbing on T. pratense and visits to L. corniculatus, though they rarely switched between other combinations of foraging types. These results indicate that factors other than perceptual stimuli and spatial distribution of plants affected foraging type constancy. After considering other factors, such as the rewards and the sizes of individual foragers, we argue that handling skills required to forage flowers affected flower constancy observed in this study.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00265-016-2057-7\", \"EISSN: 1432-0762\", \"ISSN: 0340-5443\"]}\n",

Pollen provides bees with their primary source of protein and lipids, but nutritional quality varies widely among host-plant species. Therefore, bees might have adapted to assess resource quality and adjust their foraging behavior to balance nutrition from multiple food sources. We tested the ability of two bumble bee species, Bombus terrestris and Bombus impatiens, to regulate protein and lipid intake. We restricted B. terrestris adults to single synthetic diets varying in protein:lipid ratios (P:L). The bees over-ate protein on low-fat diets and over-ate lipid on high-fat diets to reach their targets of lipid and protein, respectively. The bees survived best on a 10:1 P:L diet; the risk of dying increased as a function of dietary lipid when bees ate diets with lipid contents greater than 5:1 P:L. Hypothesizing that the P:L intake target of adult worker bumble bees was between 25:1 and 5:1, we presented workers from both species with unbalanced but complementary paired diets to determine whether they self-select their diet to reach a specific intake target. Bees consumed similar amounts of proteins and lipids in each treatment and averaged a 14:1 P:L for B. terrestris and 12:1 P:L for B. impatiens These results demonstrate that adult worker bumble bees likely select foods that provide them with a specific ratio of P:L.

The peripheral large-area component of floral colour patterns attracts flower visitors from some distance and the central small-area component guides flower visitors towards landing sites. Whereas the peripheral colour is largely variable among species, the central colour, produced mostly by anthers and pollen or pollen mimicking floral guides, is predominantly yellow and UV-absorbing. This holds also for yellow flowers that regularly display a UV bull's eye pattern. Here we show that yellow-flowering Crocus species are a noticeable exception, since yellow-flowering Crocus species-being entirely UV-absorbing-exhibit low colour contrast between yellow reproductive organs and yellow tepals. The elongated yellow or orange-yellow style of Crocus flowers is a stamen-mimicking structure promoting cross-pollination by facilitating flower visitors' contact with the apical stigma before the flower visitors are touching the anthers. Since Crocus species possess either yellow, violet or white tepals, the colour contrast between the stamen-mimicking style and the tepals varies among species. In this study comprising 106 Crocus species, it was tested whether the style length of Crocus flowers is dependent on the corolla colour. The results show that members of the genus Crocus with yellow tepals have evolved independently up to twelve times in the genus Crocus and that yellow-flowering Crocus species possess shorter styles as compared to violet- and white-flowering ones. The manipulation of flower visitors by anther-mimicking elongated styles in Crocus flowers is discussed.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 27124278\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0154728\"]}\n",

Their contribution to this essential ecosystem service has been threatened over recent decades by changes in land use, which have led to declines in their populations.Â InÂ order to design effective conservation measures, it is important to understand the effects of variation in landscape composition and structure on the foraging activities of worker bumble bees. This is because the viability of individual colonies is likely to be affected by the tradeâ€off between the energetic costs of foraging over greater distances and the potential gains from access to additional resources. We used field surveys, molecular genetics, and fine resolution remote sensing to estimate the locations of wild bumble bee nests and to infer foraging distances across a 20â€kmÂ² agricultural landscape in southern England, UK. We investigated five species, including the rare B.Â ruderatus and ecologically similar but widespread B.Â hortorum. We compared worker foraging distances between species and examined how variation in landscape composition and structure affected foraging distances at the colony level. Mean worker foraging distances differed significantly between species. Bombus terrestris, B.Â lapidarius, and B. ruderatus exhibited significantly greater mean foraging distances (551, 536, and 501Â m, respectively) than B. hortorum and B.Â pascuorum (336 and 272Â m, respectively). There was wide variation in worker foraging distances between colonies of the same species, which was in turn strongly influenced by the amount and spatial configuration of available foraging habitats. Shorter foraging distances were found for colonies where the local landscape had high coverage and low fragmentation of seminatural vegetation, including managed agriâ€environmental field margins. The strength of relationships between different landscape variables and foraging distance varied between species, for example the strongest relationship for B. ruderatus being with floral cover of preferred forage plants. Our findings suggest that management of landscape composition and configuration has the potential to reduce foraging distances across a range of bumble bee species. There is thus potential for improvements in the design and implementation of landscape management options, such as agriâ€environment schemes, aimed at providing foraging habitat for bumble bees and enhancing crop pollination services.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 27411246\", \"EISSN: 1939-5582\", \"DOI: 10.1890/15-0546\", \"ISSN: 1051-0761\"]}\n",

The chemical analyses revealed that supplementing air with ozone led to an increasing reduction in the concentrations of floral volatiles in air with distance from the volatile source. The results revealed different reactivities with ozone for different floral scent constituents, which emphasized that ozone exposure not only degrades floral scents, but also changes the ratios of compounds in a scent blend. Behavioural tests revealed that floral scent was reduced in its attractiveness to pollinators after it had been exposed to 120 ppb O₃ over a 4.5 m distance.

How individuals establish such foraging areas in the presence of other foragers is poorly explored. Here we investigated the foraging patterns of pairs of bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) released sequentially into an 880m2 outdoor flight cage containing 10 feeding stations (artificial flowers). Using motion-sensitive video cameras mounted on flowers, we mapped the flower visitation networks of both foragers, quantified their interactions and compared their foraging success over an entire day. Overall, bees that were released first (residents) travelled 37% faster and collected 77% more nectar, thereby reaching a net energy intake rate 64% higher than bees released second (newcomers). However, this prior-experience advantage decreased as newcomers became familiar with the spatial configuration of the flower array. When both bees visited the same flower simultaneously, the most frequent outcome was for the resident to evict the newcomer. On the rare occasions when newcomers evicted residents, the two bees increased their frequency of return visits to that flower. These competitive interactions led to a significant (if only partial) spatial overlap between the foraging patterns of pairs of bees. While newcomers may initially use social cues (such as olfactory footprints) to exploit flowers used by residents, either because such cues indicate higher rewards and/or safety from predation, residents may attempt to preserve their monopoly over familiar resources through exploitation and interference. We discuss how these interactions may favour spatial partitioning, thereby maximising the foraging efficiency of individuals and colonies.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0150844\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

For fine color discrimination, bees require differential conditioning with a concurrent presentation of target and distractor stimuli to form a long-term memory. Here we investigated whether the long-term storage of color information shapes the neural network of microglomeruli in the mushroom body calyces and if this depends on the type of conditioning. Free-flying honeybees were individually trained to a pair of perceptually similar colors in either absolute conditioning towards one of the colors or in differential conditioning with both colors. Subsequently, bees of either conditioning groups were tested in non-rewarded discrimination tests with the two colors. Only bees trained with differential conditioning preferred the previously learned color, whereas bees of the absolute conditioning group, and a stimuli-naïve group, chose randomly among color stimuli. All bees were then kept individually for three days in the dark to allow for complete long-term memory formation. Whole-mount immunostaining was subsequently used to quantify variation of microglomeruli number and density in the mushroom-body lip and collar. We found no significant differences among groups in neuropil volumes and total microglomeruli numbers, but learning performance was negatively correlated with microglomeruli density in the absolute conditioning group. Based on these findings we aim to promote future research approaches combining behaviorally relevant color learning tests in honeybees under free-flight conditions with neuroimaging analysis; we also discuss possible limitations of this approach.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0164386\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"PMID: 27783640\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

Here, we assessed the impact of foliar herbivory on DNA methylation and floral traits in the model crop plant Brassica rapa. Methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism (MSAP) analysis showed that leaf damage by the caterpillar Pieris brassicae was associated with genome-wide methylation changes in both leaves and flowers of B. rapa as well as a downturn in flower number, morphology and scent. A comparison to plants with jasmonic acid-induced defence showed similar demethylation patterns in leaves, but both the floral methylome and phenotype differed significantly from P. brassicae infested plants. Standardised genome-wide demethylation with 5-azacytidine in five different B. rapa full-sib groups further resulted in a genotype-specific downturn of floral morphology and scent, which significantly reduced the attractiveness of the plants to the pollinator bee Bombus terrestris. These results suggest that DNA methylation plays an important role in adjusting plant signalling in response to changing insect communities.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0166646\", \"PMID: 27870873\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

Although entomologists have used direct observation and mark-and-recapture techniques as tracking methods, there are drawbacks such as low recapture rates in the case of marking techniques. The objective of this study was to quantitatively examine adhesive bond strength between radar tag and insect body and to evaluate the effect of tag attachment on flight behavior and capacity of five economically important insect species, including three pest species, Riptortus pedestris (Hemiptera: Alydidae), Lycorma delicatula (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae), and Ricania sp. (Hemiptera: Ricaniidae) and two pollinators, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae). The adhesive bond strength was substantially different among these five insect species, but the strength was sufficiently strong for operational use in harmonic radar tagging except in Ricania sp. Bond strength on B. terrestris was 817±43.65g-forces, which was the strongest among the five species tested, while that on Ricania sp. was 1.7±0.20g-forces, which was the weakest. For all insects, no significant correlation between bond strength and insect body size was observed. The radar tag attachment affected the flight behavior and capacity of five insect species in different ways. The radar tag attachment did not significantly affect the propensity of R. pedestris, L. delicatula, or B. terrestris to takeoff compared to untagged individuals. However, the takeoff propensities of A. mellifera and Ricania sp. were negatively affected by the radar tag attachment. Flight capacities of R. pedestris, A. mellifera, and B. terrestris were not affected by the tag attachment compared to untagged individuals, but the flight capacity of Ricania sp. was negatively affected by the tag attachment. The results of this study indicate that the radar technique has promising potential for R. pedestris, L. delicatula, and B. terrestris. However, this technique may have limited potential for A. mellifera and Ricania sp. because the radar tag can significantly affect their flight behavior.\\n[Display omitted]\\n•Harmonic radar tracking system has been introduced to understand insect movement.•The potential of using harmonic radar was examined for five important insects.•The radar has promising potential for R. pedestris, L. delicatula, and B. terrestris.•However, the radar adversely affected dispersal capacity of A. mellifera and Ricania sp.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1226-8615\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.aspen.2016.03.013\", \"EISSN: 1876-7990\"]}\n",

Furthermore, the expressed mixture of AMPs varies with host genetic background and infecting parasite strain (genotype). Here, we used the fact that clones ofC. bombican be cultivated and kept as strains in medium to test the effect of various combinations of AMPs on the growth rate of the parasite. In particular, we used pairwise combinations and a range of physiological concentrations of three AMPs, namelyAbaecin,DefensinandHymenoptaecin, synthetized from the respective genomic sequences. We found that these AMPs indeed suppress the growth of eight different strains ofC. bombi, and that combinations of AMPs were typically more effective than the use of a single AMP alone. Furthermore, the most effective combinations were rarely those consisting of maximum concentrations. In addition, the AMP combination treatments revealed parasite strain specificity, such that strains varied in their sensitivity towards the same mixtures. Hence, variable expression of AMPs could be an alternative strategy to combat highly variable infections.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Evolutionary ecology of arthropod antimicrobial peptides’.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0962-8436\", \"PMID: 27160603\", \"EISSN: 1471-2970\", \"ISSN: 1471-2970\", \"DOI: 10.1098/rstb.2015.0302\"]}\n",

We identified how each bee's flights fit into two categories-which we named exploration and exploitation flights-examining the differences between the two types of flight and how their occurrence changed over the course of the bees' foraging careers. Exploitation of learned resources takes place during efficient, straight trips, usually to a single foraging location, and is seldom combined with exploration of other areas. Exploration of the landscape typically occurs in the first few flights made by each bee, but our data show that further exploration flights can be made throughout the bee's foraging career. Bees showed striking levels of variation in how they explored their environment, their fidelity to particular patches, ratio of exploration to exploitation, duration and frequency of their foraging bouts. One bee developed a straight route to a forage patch within four flights and followed this route exclusively for six days before abandoning it entirely for a closer location; this second location had not been visited since her first exploratory flight nine days prior. Another bee made only rare exploitation flights and continued to explore widely throughout its life; two other bees showed more frequent switches between exploration and exploitation.

To test this, we investigated the effect of acute thiamethoxam exposure on spatial working memory in the bumblebee\\nBombus terrestris\\n, using an adaptation of the radial-arm maze (RAM). We first demonstrated that bumblebees use spatial working memory to solve the RAM by showing that untreated bees performed significantly better than would be expected if choices were random or governed by stereotyped visitation rules.

The high dose caused bees to make more and earlier spatial memory errors and take longer to complete the task than unexposed bees. For the low doses, the negative effects were smaller but statistically significant, and dependent on bee size. The spatial working memory impairment shown here has the potential to harm bees exposed to thiamethoxam, through possible impacts on foraging efficiency or homing.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 27958350\", \"EISSN: 2045-2322\", \"DOI: 10.1038/srep38957\", \"ISSN: 2045-2322\"]}\n",

This has epidemiological consequences for parasites, because in ‘fast-paced’ colonies, with short-lived workers, the time of parasite residence in a given host will be reduced, and further transmission may thus get less likely. Here, we test this idea and ask whether pace is a life-history strategy against infectious parasites. We infected bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) with the infectious gut parasite Crithidia bombi, and experimentally manipulated birth and death rates to mimic slow and fast pace. We found that fewer workers and, importantly, fewer last-generation workers that are responsible for rearing sexuals were infected in colonies with faster pace. This translates into increased fitness in fast-paced colonies, as daughter queens exposed to fewer infected workers in the nest are less likely to become infected themselves, and have a higher chance of founding their own colonies in the next year. High worker turnover rate can thus act as a strategy of defence against a spreading infection in social insect colonies.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 26763696\", \"ISSN: 1471-2954\", \"ISSN: 0962-8452\", \"EISSN: 1471-2954\", \"DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2015.1919\"]}\n",

One of these structures, the diffraction grating, is found both in animals (for example, beetles [2]) and in plants (on the petals of some animal pollinated flowers [5]). The behavioral impacts of floral iridescence and its potential ecological significance are unknown [6–9]. Animal-pollinated flowers are described as “sensory billboards” [10], with many floral features contributing to a conspicuous display that filters prospective pollinators. Yet floral iridescence is more subtle to the human eye than that of many animal displays because the floral diffraction grating is not perfectly regular [5–9]. This presents a puzzle: if the function of petals is to attract pollinators, then flowers might be expected to optimize iridescence to increase showiness. On the other hand, pollinators memorize floral colors as consistent advertisements of reward quality, and iridescence might corrupt flower color identity. Here we tested the trade-off between flower detectability and recognition, requiring bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) to identify artificial flowers that varied in pigmentation and degree of iridescence. We find that iridescence does increase target detectability but that “perfect” iridescence (produced by an artificial diffraction grating) corrupts target identity and bees make many mistakes. However, “imperfect” floral iridescence does not lead to mistaken target identity, while still benefitting flower detectability. We hypothesize that similar trade-offs might be found in the many naturally “imperfect” iridescence-producing structures found in animal-animal, as well as other plant-animal, interactions.\\n•Iridescence can increase object detectability•Iridescence can increase the disruption of accurate color identification•Detectability and disruption are influenced by variation in iridescent structures•Floral iridescence is an optimal trade-off between detectability and identification\\nSome animal-pollinated flowers are iridescent, but this iridescence is subtle when compared to bolder animal iridescence.

In this work, we compared the impact of three common commercial blends on the development of bumblebee microcolonies, namely, Actinidia deliciosa L., Cistus sp., and Salix sp. We focus on amino acids (i.e., composition and amount), as they are currently used as an indicator of diet performance. Five parameters were used to determine microcolonies growth rate: 1) number of eggs, 2) number of alive larvae, 3) number of ejected larvae, 4) number of pupae, and 5) total number of offspring. Syrup collection was also monitored to estimate energetic requirement for colony growth. Results revealed that the three commercial blends chemically differed in their amino acid contents, with those displaying higher concentrations (i.e., Salix sp. and A. deliciosa) accelerating microcolony development along with an increase of syrup collection. The advantages of rearing bumblebee commercial colonies using a pollen diet with an optimal amino acid content are discussed.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1938-291X\", \"ISSN: 0022-0493\", \"DOI: 10.1093/jee/tov279\", \"EISSN: 1938-291X\", \"PMID: 26385047\"]}\n",

The results clearly demonstrated that, for fruit set, pollination is crucial.

To understand the current situation with pollinator availability in cherry and plum orchards, observations have been made on anthophilous insect diversity from 2013 to 2015. Results demonstrate that flowers of sour cherries and domestic plums attract insects from three main taxonomic groups – Coleoptera (31.9%), Diptera (37.8%), and Hymenoptera (30.4%). Observations showed that traditional pollinators, bees and bumblebees, visited flowers in low numbers. Flowers of sour cherries showed higher attraction to bees than those of domestic plums did. It was observed that native bumblebees were not attracted by flowers of both crops, but buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) from artificial colonies quite actively visited flowers of sour cherries.

This is also the case for bumblebees, Bombus terrestris, when infected by the trypanosome, Crithidia bombi. Furthermore, the expressed mixture of AMPs varies with host genetic background and infecting parasite strain (genotype). Here, we used the fact that clones of C. bombi can be cultivated and kept as strains in medium to test the effect of various combinations of AMPs on the growth rate of the parasite. In particular, we used pairwise combinations and a range of physiological concentrations of three AMPs, namely Abaecin, Defensin and Hymenoptaecin, synthetized from the respective genomic sequences. We found that these AMPs indeed suppress the growth of eight different strains of C. bombi, and that combinations of AMPs were typically more effective than the use of a single AMP alone. Furthermore, the most effective combinations were rarely those consisting of maximum concentrations. In addition, the AMP combination treatments revealed parasite strain specificity, such that strains varied in their sensitivity towards the same mixtures. Hence, variable expression of AMPs could be an alternative strategy to combat highly variable infections.

This has epidemiological consequences for parasites, because in 'fast-paced' colonies, with short-lived workers, the time of parasite residence in a given host will be reduced, and further transmission may thus get less likely. Here, we test this idea and ask whether pace is a life-history strategy against infectious parasites. We infected bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) with the infectious gut parasite Crithidia bombi, and experimentally manipulated birth and death rates to mimic slow and fast pace. We found that fewer workers and, importantly, fewer last-generation workers that are responsible for rearing sexuals were infected in colonies with faster pace. This translates into increased fitness in fast-paced colonies, as daughter queens exposed to fewer infected workers in the nest are less likely to become infected themselves, and have a higher chance of founding their own colonies in the next year. High worker turnover rate can thus act as a strategy of defence against a spreading infection in social insect colonies.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0962-8452\", \"EISSN: 1471-2954\"]}\n",

Small-brained insects are no exception (Grüter and Leadbeater, 2014). For instance, inexperienced bumblebees learn to identify profitable flower species by observing conspecifics (Leadbeater and Chittka, 2005). Bumblebees are especially suitable to study insect social learning as they can be easily tested in the lab, allowing for precise control of food resources, individual experience and social cues (Avarguès-Weber et al., 2015). Here we comment on two recent studies showing how bumblebees use personal and social information discriminately to make adaptive foraging decisions, thus setting the scene for complex social foraging dynamics among bees exploiting variable ressources in the field. Writing in Current Biology, Dunlap et al. (2016) report that foragers of the common eastern bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) rely more on social information than on personal information if the former predicts a reward. The authors trained bumblebees to collect sucrose solution in arrays of 12 artificial flowers in which they manipulated personal information (by using yellow or orange flowers) and social information (by marking some flowers with a pinned dried conspecific). During training, each type of information was either fully reliable (100% of flowers rewarded), moderately reliable (83% of flowers rewarded), or unreliable (50% of flowers rewarded) in a full factorial design of nine treatments. Bumblebees were equally successful at associating personal and social information to a reward. However during the test, in which only unrewarded flowers of all four types were used, most bumblebees preferred flowers with a conspecific. For treatments in which social information was moderately or highly reliable, bumblebees always preferred flowers with a conspecific, even if personal information was more reliable. When both information were unreliable, bumblebees did not show any preference. Only, when social information was unreliable and personal information moderately or highly reliable, bumblebees preferred flowers without a conspecific. In another study published in Biology Letters, Smolla et al.

In Experiment 1, we tested how expression changes with queen relative age and productivity. We found a significant age-related increase in COQ7 expression in queen ovary. In brain, all four genes showed higher expression with increasing female (queen plus worker) production, with this relationship strengthening as queen age increased, suggesting a link with the positive association of fecundity and longevity found in eusocial insect queens. In Experiment 2, we tested effects of relative age and social environment (worker removal) in foundress queens and effects of age and reproductive status in workers. In this experiment, workerless queens showed significantly higher for expression in brain, as predicted if downregulation of for is associated with the cessation of foraging by foundress queens following worker emergence. Workers showed a significant age-related increase in Dnmt3 expression in fat body, suggesting a novel association between aging and methylation in B. terrestris. Ovary activation was associated with significantly higher vg expression in fat body and, in younger workers, in brain, consistent with vitellogenin's ancestral role in regulating egg production.

In this study, we examine the genetic structuring of B. ruderatus populations in the South Island of New Zealand and we demonstrate that a relatively simple classification of the landscape, into either good or poor foraging habitat at coarse resolution (800 m²), can predict levels of gene flow. We found populations of B. ruderatus as far apart as 160 km showing no significant genetic differentiation. However, this level of gene flow appears to be reliant upon continuous suitable habitat, as other populations <100 km apart were found to be significantly differentiated.

By successively reducing environmental and floral cues, we analyzed pollen-foraging preferences of Bombus impatiens in (i) host-plant species, (ii) pollen isolated from these host-plant species, and (iii) nutritionally modified single-source pollen diets encompassing a range of protein and lipid concentrations. In our semifield experiments, B. impatiens foragers exponentially increased their foraging rates of pollen from plant species with high protein: lipid (P:L) ratios; the most preferred plant species had the highest ratio (∼4.6:1). These preferences were confirmed in cage studies where, in pairwise comparisons in the absence of other floral cues, B. impatiens workers still preferred pollen with higher P:L ratios. Finally, when presented with nutritionally modified pollen, workers were most attracted to pollen with P:L ratios of 5:1 and 10:1, but increasing the protein or lipid concentration (while leaving ratios intact) reduced attraction. Thus, macronutritional ratios appear to be a primary factor driving bee pollen-foraging behavior and may explain observed patterns of host-plant visitation across the landscape.

Using comparative phylogenetic analysis and a bee vision model, we also compared the colour patterns of P. micranthum with those of its congeners and sympatric food flowers.\\nThe probability of both long‐range approach and close‐up choice by bumblebees to orchids was all enhanced in communities with food flowers similar in colour pattern to the orchid.

Flowers of P. micranthum that were manipulated to reduce visual complexity had reduced male and female pollination success.\\nPhylogenetic analysis revealed that the outer floral colour of P. micranthum is apomorphic and thus likely represents an evolutionary innovation, whereas the central colour is plesiomorphic and thus likely to function in the bumblebee pollination system as an exaptation. The contrast between the inner and outer colours appears to exploit visual preferences of bumblebees acquired during foraging on local food plants with similar colour patterns.\\nThis study highlights the adaptive significance of colour patterns in successful food deception and the importance of complex signals in facilitating interspecific interactions.\\nLay Summary\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1365-2435\", \"CODEN: FECOE5\", \"ISSN: 0269-8463\", \"EISSN: 1365-2435\", \"DOI: 10.1111/1365-2435.12571\"]}\n",

Although the consensus among scientists is that the interaction of many factors, including habitat loss, forage scarcity, diseases, parasites, and pesticides, potentially plays a role in causing these declines, pesticides have received considerable attention and scrutiny. In response, regulatory agencies have introduced more stringent pollinator testing requirements for registration and reregistration of pesticides, to ensure that the risks to pollinators are minimized. In this context, guidelines for testing bumble bees (Bombus spp.) in regulatory studies are not yet available, and a pressing need exists to develop suitable protocols for routine higher‐tier studies with these non‐Apis sp., social bees. To meet this need, Bayer CropScience LP, Syngenta Crop Protection LLC US, and Valent USA. Corporation organized a workshop bringing together a group of global experts on bumble bee behavior, ecology, and ecotoxicology to discuss and develop draft protocols for both semi‐field (Tier II) and field (Tier III) studies. The workshop was held May 8–9, 2014, at the Bayer Bee Care Center, North Carolina, USA. The participants represented academic, consulting, and industry scientists from Europe, Canada, the United States, and Brazil. The workshop identified a clear protection goal and generated proposals for basic experimental designs, relevant measurements, and endpoints for both semifield (tunnel) and field tests. These initial recommendations are intended to form the basis of discussions to help advance the development of appropriate protocol guidelines.

Inbreeding leads to homozygosity at the sex locus and the production of non-viable diploid males. This means that island populations of bees are particularly prone to extinction. Here we determine the levels of diversity and isolation between islands and mainland populations of the bumble bee Bombus morioÂ in southeast Brazil. We analyzed 659 individuals from 24 populations, sequencing two mitochondrial genes (COI and Cytb) and genotyping all individuals at 14 microsatellite loci. Surprisingly, genetic diversity was high and genetic isolation was low in all populations except Teodoro Sampaio (mainland) and Ilha da VitÃ³ria (island). Genetic diversity is not significantly correlated with island area, but is lower in populations that are more distant from the mainland. Except perhaps for Ilha da VitÃ³ria, we suggest that the island populations are unlikely to go extinct due to genetic factors. Finally, based on its genetic distance from all other populations, we identify a putative new subspecies in the Teodoro Sampaio region.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s10841-016-9872-z\", \"EISSN: 1572-9753\", \"ISSN: 1366-638X\"]}\n",

Mothers of the small carpenter bee, Ceratina calcarata, provide smaller pollen balls to their first female offspring resulting in the development of a smaller female. This smaller female, known as the dwarf eldest daughter, is coerced to stay at the nest to forage and feed siblings as a worker. In order to better understand how this maternal manipulation leads to the physiological and behavioral differences observed in dwarf eldest daughters, we characterized and compared the quality of the pollen balls fed to theses females vs. other offspring. Our results confirm earlier studies reporting that there is a female-biased sex allocation in the first brood cell position and these daughters received mass provisions significantly smaller than other daughters. In addition to the smaller quantities of pollen provisioned, we found evidence for maternal control of the quality of pollen invested in the dwarf eldest daughters. Late brood cells receive pollen balls with significantly less floral diversity than early brood cells. This difference in floral diversity affects the protein content of the pollen balls; in that, older offspring receive less protein than their younger siblings. These results reveal that C. calcarata mothers manipulate not only the quantity but also the quality of the provision provided to her first offspring to create a small worker she is able to coerce to remain at the nest to help raise her siblings. This overlapping of generations and division of labor between mother and dwarf eldest daughter may represent the first steps in the evolution of highly social groups. One of the major transitions to the formation of highly social groups is division of labor. By manipulating resource availability to offspring, parents can force offspring to remain at the nest to serve as a worker leading to a division of labor between parent and offspring. In the small carpenter bee, C. calcarata, mothers provide their eldest daughter with less food resulting in a smaller adult body size. This dwarf eldest daughter (DED) does not have the opportunity to reproduce and serves only as a worker for the colony. In addition to overall reduced investment, we found that mothers also provide a different variety of pollen to her DED. By exploring the factors and mechanisms that influence maternal manipulation in a non-eusocial bee, we can begin to understand one of the major transitions in social group formation.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00265-016-2194-z\", \"EISSN: 1432-0762\", \"ISSN: 0340-5443\"]}\n",

In this sense, hummingbird‐pollinated flowers are frequently red‐coloured, and there are two tentative hypotheses to explain this pattern: 1. hummingbirds are attracted to red due its easier detection and 2. bees are sensorially excluded from red flowers. The second hypothesis is based on bees’ red colour blindness, which lead them to be less frequent and less important than hummingbirds as pollinators of red‐reflecting flowers.\\nHere, we untangled the role of different flower traits mediating plant–pollinator interactions and empirically tested the above hypotheses. We chose Costus arabicus due to its synchronopatric white‐ and pink‐flowered individuals and its bee and hummingbird pollination system. Although pink flowers are not totally achromatic as pure red ones, they show an achromaticity degree that could drive bee exclusion. Specifically, we tested whether differences on red reflectance work attracting hummingbirds or excluding bees and the consequent implications for the plant's reproduction.\\nFlower colour morphs of C. arabicus do differ neither in morphology nor in nectar sugar content. Moreover, white and pink flowers can be discriminated by the bees’ and hummingbirds’ colour vision system. Both groups are able to discriminate the red colour variation morph on the flower petals, the white flowers being more easily detected by bees and the pink flowers by hummingbirds. Bees preferentially visited the white flowers, whereas hummingbirds visited both colours at the same rate – both patterns corroborating the second hypothesis.\\nPollen loads deposited on stigmas did not differ between flower colour morphs, indicating that bees and hummingbirds play a similar role in the overall pollen deposition. However, bees are more likely to self‐pollinate than hummingbirds. Self‐pollination limits C. arabicus reproduction, and red‐reflecting flowers may be better pollinated by discouraging bee visitation. Therefore, the intraspecific colour variation is driving flowers to show colour‐related different levels of generalization.\\nOur results support the ‘bee avoidance’ rather than the ‘hummingbird preference’ hypothesis. Sensory exclusion of bees seems to be the pressure for red‐reflecting flowers evolution, driving specialization in hummingbird‐pollinated flowers due to the costs of bee pollination on plant reproduction.\\nLay Summary\", \"identifier\": [\"CODEN: FECOE5\", \"ISSN: 0269-8463\", \"DOI: 10.1111/1365-2435.12537\", \"EISSN: 1365-2435\"]}\n",

To assess the contribution of different structures to the overall visual signal of flowers, we used an optical model, where a petal is considered as a stack of differently pigmented and structured layers and we interpreted the visual signals of the model petals with insect vision models. We show that the reflectance depends, in addition to the pigmentation, on the petal's thickness and the inhomogeneity of its interior. We find large between-species differences in floral pigments, pigment concentration and localization, as well as floral interior structure. The fractions of reflected and transmitted light are remarkably similar between the studied species, suggesting common selective pressures of pollinator visual systems. Our optical model highlights that pigment localization crucially determines the efficiency of pigmentary filtering and thereby the chromatic contrast and saturation of the visual signal.

We also quantified virus titers in these bees, providing, for the first time, an assessment of viral load in a broad spectrum of wild bees. Although virus detection was very common, virus levels in the wild bees were minimal-similar to or lower than foraging honey bees and substantially lower than honey bees collected from hives. Furthermore, when we experimentally inoculated adults of two different bee species (Megachile rotundata and Colletes inaequalis) with a mixture of common viruses that is lethal to honey bees, we saw no effect on short term survival. Overall, we found that honey bee RNA viruses can be commonly detected at low levels in many wild bee species, but we found no evidence that these pathogens cause elevated short-term mortality effects.

We fed honey bees with different diets composed of pollen pellets collected by honey bees in an agricultural landscape of western France. Slight drops (5-10%) in the availability of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) pollen resulted in significant reductions of all tested variables. Despite some variations in taxonomic diversity and nutritional quality, the pollen mixes harvested over the season had a similar positive influence on honey bee health, except for the one collected in late July that induced poor survival and nursing physiology. This period coincided with the mass-flowering of maize (Zea mays L.), an anemophilous crop which produces poor-quality pollen. Therefore, changes in bee health were not connected to variations in pollen diversity but rather to variations in pollen depletion and quality, such as can be encountered in an intensive agricultural system of western France.

Although natural landmarks are scarce and the ants mainly depend on path integration for returning to the starting point, they can also learn and use landmarks successfully to navigate through their largely featureless habitat. Here we study how the ants acquire this information at the beginning of their outdoor lives within a nest-surrounding array of three artificial black cylinders. Individually marked ‘newcomers’ exhibit a characteristic sequence of learning walks. The meandering learning walks covering all directions of the compass first occur only within a few centimeters distance from the nest entrance, but then increasingly widen, until after three to seven learning walks foraging starts. When displaced to a distant test field in which an identical array of landmarks has been installed, the ants shift their search density peaks the more closely to the fictive goal position, the more learning walks they have performed.

We analyzed learning flights in ground-nesting wasps (Sphecidae: Cerceris australis) using synchronized high-speed cameras to determine 3D head position and orientation. Wasps move along arcs centered on the nest entrance, whereby rapid changes in gaze assure that the nest is seen at lateral positions in the left or the right visual field. Between saccades, the wasps translate along arc segments around the nest while keeping gaze fixed. We reconstructed panoramic views along the paths of learning and homing wasps to test specific predictions about what wasps learn during their learning flights and how they use this information to guide their return. Our evidence suggests that wasps monitor changing views during learning flights and use the differences they experience relative to previously encountered views to decide when to begin a new arc. Upon encountering learned views, homing wasps move left or right, depending on the nest direction associated with that view, and in addition appear to be guided by features on the ground close to the nest.

We show that pesticide exposure and pathogen infection have not yet been found to interact to affect worker survival under field‐realistic scenarios. Colony‐level implications of pesticide effects on Nosema infections, viral loads and honey bee immunity remain unclear as these effects have been observed in a laboratory setting only using a small range of pesticide exposures, generally exceeding those likely to occur in the natural environment, and assessing a highly selected series of immune‐related endpoints. Future research priorities include the need for a better understanding of pesticide effects on the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) component of an individual's immune response and on social defence behaviours.

When C. floridanus workers’ food was supplemented with this hormone, the larvae they reared via trophallaxis were twice as likely to complete metamorphosis and became larger workers.

A total of 20 different intentions for the introduction of terrestrial invertebrates were identified. Uses and trade patterns have changed over time and further changes are likely in the future. In particular, invertebrates used in the pet trade, and as human food and animal feed are likely to increase in relevance. We assess priorities for future research and regulation based on the perceived “risk” of the uses including propagule pressure, security of captivity and ease of regulation. Regarding risk assessment, we examine three options: (a) using an existing generic protocol developed for a broad range of taxa; (b) developing a new protocol, possibly by adapting a protocol developed for other taxa; and (c) adopting the approach applied for biological control, i.e. structured experiments and observations. This review highlights the diversity of uses and associated threats of intentional terrestrial invertebrate introductions. It provides recommendations on how to tackle and prevent related issues and can therefore serve as a guideline for future work. We argue that the most suitable option for risk assessment might depend on the type or organism and the level of knowledge of the organism, as well as the intended use.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1387-3547\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s10530-016-1086-5\", \"EISSN: 1573-1464\"]}\n",

Recent losses of both managed and wild bee species have negative impacts on crop production and ecosystem diversity. Therefore, in order to mitigate bee losses, it is important to identify the factors most responsible. Multiple factors including pathogens, agrochemical exposure, lack of quality forage, and reduced habitat affect bee health. Pathogen prevalence is one factor that has been associated with colony losses. Numerous pathogens infect bees including fungi, protists, bacteria, and viruses, the majority of which are RNA viruses including several that infect multiple bee species. RNA viruses readily infect bees, yet there is limited understanding of their impacts on bee health, particularly in the context of other stressors.

In this work a comparative analysis of the mechanisms of lipid storage in the CSGs of Apis mellifera (Linnaeus, 1758) and Scaptotrigona postica (Latreille, 1807) workers was carried out. The ultrastructural location of lipids was ascertained using imidazole-osmium (IO), using individuals in different stages of their life cycles. Lipid deposits were identified inside glandular cells and in the alveolar lumens in all individuals, but differences were observed between the species. The glandular cells of A. mellifera workers presented positive reactions to IO as droplets dispersed in the cytoplasm, as vesicles and in the channels formed by apical plasma membrane infolds. In S. postica , lipid compounds were detected inside the mitochondrial matrix and in smooth endoplasmic reticulum cisterns.

In some species of social bees and wasps with annual societies, this intra-colony conflict even results in matricideâ€”the killing of the colonyâ€™s irreplaceable queen by a daughter worker. In colonies with low effective paternity and high worker-worker relatedness, workers value worker-laid males more than queen-laid males, and thus may benefit from queen killing. Workers gain by eliminating the queen because she is a competing source of male eggs and actively inhibits worker reproduction through policing. However, matricide may be costly to workers if it reduces the production of valuable new queens and workers. Here, I test a theoretical prediction regarding the timing of matricide in a wasp, Dolichovespula arenaria, recently shown to have facultative matricide based on intra-colony relatedness. Using analyses of collected, mature colonies and a surgical manipulation preventing queens from laying female eggs, I show that workers do not preferentially kill queens who are only producing male eggs. Instead, workers sometimes kill queens laying valuable females, suggesting a high cost of matricide. Although matricide is common and typically occurs only in low-paternity colonies, it seems that workers sometimes pay substantial costs in this expression of conflict over male parentage.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00114-016-1384-x\", \"PMID: 27350328\", \"ISSN: 0028-1042\", \"EISSN: 1432-1904\"]}\n",

Here we studied the impact of contact with the bumblebee colony on the colonization potential of the bacterial families (i.e., Neisseriaceae, Orbaceae, Lactobacillaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae) occurring in the gut of adult bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Bacterial profiles of the gut microbiota of B. terrestris were determined based on the hypervariable V4 region of the 16S rRNA using paired‐end Illumina sequencing. In our experiments, we created different groups in which we gradually reduced the contact with nest mates and hive material. We made 3 observations: (i) reducing the contact between the colony and the bumblebee during adult life resulted in a significant drop in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus bombicola and Lactobacillus bombi; (ii) Bifidobacteriaceae required contact with nest mates to colonize the gut of B. terrestris and a significant lower bacterial diversity was observed in bumblebees that were completely excluded from colony contact during the adult life; (iii) Snodgrassella and Gilliamella were able to colonize the gut of the adult bumblebee without any direct contact with nest mates in the adult life stage.

SBPV infection resulted in significant virulence under starvation conditions, with infected bees 1.6 times more likely to die at any given time point (a median of 2.3 h earlier than uninfected bees), whereas there was no effect under satiated conditions. This demonstrates clear condition-dependent virulence for SBPV in B. terrestris. Infections that appear asymptomatic in non-stressful laboratory assays may nevertheless have significant impacts under natural conditions in the wild. For multi-host pathogens such as SBPV, the use of sentinel host species in laboratory assays may further lead to the underestimation of pathogen impacts on other species in nature. In this case the impact of ‘honeybee viruses’ on wild pollinators may be underestimated, with detrimental effects on conservation and food security. Our results highlight the importance of multiple assays and multiple host species when testing for virulence, in order for laboratory studies to accurately inform conservation policy and mitigate disease impacts in wild pollinators.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1432-1939\", \"PMID: 28361244\", \"ISSN: 0029-8549\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s00442-017-3851-2\", \"ISSN: 1432-1939\"]}\n",

We focus our study on the cephalic labial gland secretions of diploid and haploid males ofBombus terrestris （L.）. Contrary to initial expectations, our results do not show any significant differentiation of cephalic labial gland secretions between diploid and haploid specimens. Queens seem therefore to be unable to avoid mating with diploid males based on their compositions of cephalic labial gland secretions.

A unique feature of greenhouse agriculture is the extensive use of fungicides to curb multiple fungal infections. The most widely used pollinating insects in greenhouses are commercially reared bumblebees. However, there is no data regarding the toxicity of fungicides to bumblebee mitochondria. To fill this gap in knowledge, we examined the effects of 16 widely used fungicides on the energetics of the flight muscles mitochondria of Bombus terrestris. We found that diniconazole and fludioxonil uncoupled the respiration of mitochondria; dithianon and difenoconazole inhibited it. By analyzing the action of these inhibitors on mitochondrial respiration and generation of reactive oxygen species, we concluded that difenoconazole inhibited electron transport at the level of Complex I and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Dithianon strongly inhibited succinate dehydrogenase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. It also strongly inhibited mitochondrial oxidation of NAD-linked substrates or glycerol 3-phosphate, but it had no effect on the enzymatic activity of Complex I.

Wind-pollinated plants, in particular, which are almost never studied in plant-pollinator networks, can alter insect-pollinated plants' attractiveness through competition for nutrients. The response of pollinators to such changes has never been investigated. 3. A pot experiment was carried out in which an insect-pollinated species, Echium plantagineum, was grown in binary mixture with three wind-pollinated species selected to exert a panel of competitive interactions. Below-ground competition was controlled using dividers limiting interspecific root competition. Floral traits of E. plantagineum (i.e. flower production, floral display size, flower size and nectar production) were measured. For each species mixture, the visits (i.e. first visit, number of visits, 10-min sequences) of Bombus terrestris individuals released in a flight cage containing two pots were followed, one with and one without below-ground competition. 4. Below-ground competition significantly affected nectar's sucrose concentration but did not influence flower and nectar production. Likewise, pollinator visits were not influenced by below-ground competition. Competitor identity significantly influenced flower and reward production of E. plantagineum, with a decrease in the presence of the most competitive wind-pollinated species.

One particular cause of habitat degradation is the increased inflow of nutrients due to anthropogenic combustion processes and large scale application of agricultural fertilizers. This nutrient pollution has been shown to affect pollinators through the loss of nectar and pollen-providing plant species. However, it may also affect pollinators through altering the nectar and pollen chemical composition of plant species, hence influencing pollinator food quality. Here, we experimentally investigated the effect of nutrient enrichment on amino acid and sugar composition of nectar and pollen in the grassland plant Sucissa pratensis, and the subsequent colony size and larval mortality of the pollinating bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We found less of the essential amino acids glycine and arginine in the pollen of fertilized plants, and more arginine, ornithine and threonine in the pollen of control plants. Nectar glucose and pollen fructose levels were lower in fertilized plants as compared to control plants. Furthermore, bumblebee colonies visiting fertilized plants showed more dead larvae than colonies visiting control plants.

As food nutritional composition has enormous consequences for the survival of animals, food items should generally be tasted before they are eaten or collected for later consumption. Even though recent studies have confirmed the importance of, for example, gustatory cues, compared with olfaction only little is known about the representation of chemotactile stimuli at the receptor level (let alone higher brain centers) in animals other than vertebrates. To better understand how invertebrates may process chemotactile cues, we used bumblebees as a model species and combined electroantennographical (EAG) recordings with a novel technique for chemotactile antennal stimulation in bees. The recorded EAG responses to chemotactile stimulation clearly separated volatile compounds by both compound identity and concentration, and could be successfully applied to test the receptor activity evoked by different types of pollen. We found that two different pollen types (apple and almond; which were readily distinguished by bumblebees in a classical conditioning task) evoked significantly distinct neural activity already at the antennal receptor level. Our novel stimulation technique therefore enables investigation of chemotactile sensing, which is highly important for assessing food nutritional quality while foraging. It can further be applied to test other chemosensory behaviors, such as mate or nest mate recognition, or to investigate whether toxic substances, e.g. in pollen, affect neuronal separation of different food types.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 28183868\", \"EISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 1477-9145\", \"ISSN: 0022-0949\", \"DOI: 10.1242/jeb.153122\"]}\n",

Seasonal adaptations enabling the bridging of periodic challenging abiotic conditions are taxonomically widespread.

Several temperate insects with over-wintering strategies play key ecosystem and economic roles, including wild bee pollinators. For example, hibernation survival in temperate bumblebees is crucial, as only new queens of future social colonies over-winter. These bees are also faced with other abiotic and biotic stressors, some of which have been linked to recent pollinator declines, such as exposure to pesticides and parasites. 3. Using a fully crossed experiment, the influence of dietary exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) and/or the prevalent bumblebee parasite Crithidia bombi on hibernation survival and hibernation weight change of Bombus terrestris bumblebee queens was investigated. 4. Both neonicotinoid and C. bombi exposures reduced hibernation success individually, but no additive or synergistic effects between the stressors were found. Further, effects were asynchronous, with early neonicotinoid effects on hibernation mortality overriding later parasite effects under combined exposures. Neonicotinoid exposure also increased hibernation weight loss of surviving queens. 5. Diapause periods, employed by numerous temperate organisms, are likely to be especially vulnerable to environmental stresses, besides the seasonal challenge for which these periods are an adaptation. Thus, diapause requires inclusion during the consideration of the impacts of such stresses. Accordingly, it is demonstrated here that naturally relevant exposures of pesticides and parasites have important detrimental effects on bumblebees during a critical hibernation period, with potential consequences for populations of these key wild pollinators.\", \"identifier\": [\"CODEN: EENTDT\", \"ISSN: 0307-6946\", \"ISSN: 1365-2311\", \"DOI: 10.1111/een.12385\", \"EISSN: 1365-2311\"]}\n",

Structural colour is the result of the interference of light from approximately regular periodic structures; some structural disorder is, however, inevitable in biological organisms.

Here we show that disordered nanostructures enable flowers to produce visual signals that are salient to bees. These disordered nanostructures (identified in most major lineages of angiosperms) have distinct anatomies but convergent optical properties; they all produce angle-dependent scattered light, predominantly at short wavelengths (ultraviolet and blue). We manufactured artificial flowers with nanoscale structures that possessed tailored levels of disorder in order to investigate how foraging bumblebees respond to this optical effect. We conclude that floral nanostructures have evolved, on multiple independent occasions, an effective degree of relative spatial disorder that generates a photonic signature that is highly salient to insect pollinators.\\nDisordered nanoscale striations on petals, tepals and bracts have evolved multiple times among flowering plants and provide a salient visual signal to foraging bumblebees (\\nBombus terrestris\\n).\\nPretty orderly disorder\\nThe natural world is always a bit fuzzy at the edges, but the fuzziness has a purpose. The surfaces of petals of many flowers have striations or ridges, which scatter light. But these arrays of ridges are not always arranged in a regimental order. In this paper, Beverley Glover and colleagues find that all of the flowering plants that they examined whose petals have such striations always display the same degree of disorder. This creates a 'blue halo' around the petals that pollinators find attractive. The authors find that similarly disorderly conduct happens in all flowering plants that are pollinated by insects or other animals, whereas the most primitive flowers, which are not pollinated by animals, seem not to have this capacity for orderly disorder.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 29045384\", \"EISSN: 1476-4687\", \"ISSN: 1476-4687\", \"ISSN: 0028-0836\", \"DOI: 10.1038/nature24285\"]}\n",

Within the social insects, structured contact networks have been suggested to limit the spread of diseases to vulnerable members of their society, such as the queen or brood. However, even these complex social structures do not provide complete protection, as some diseases, which are transmitted by workers during brood care, can still infect the brood. Given the high rate of feeding interactions that occur in a social insect colony, larvae may act as disease transmission hubs.

In these systems, a pollinator's size relative to the flower may be an important feature determining whether the visitor touches both male and female sexual organs and thus transfers pollen between plants efficiently. To date, few studies have addressed whether in fact the “fit” between flower and pollinator influences pollen transfer, particularly among buzz‐pollinated species. Here we use Solanum rostratum, a buzz‐pollinated plant with dimorphic anthers and mirror‐image flowers, to investigate whether the morphological fit between the pollinator's body and floral morphology influences pollen deposition. We hypothesized that when the size of the pollinator matches the separation between the sexual organs in a flower, more pollen should be transferred to the stigma than when the visitor is either too small or too big relative to the flower. To test this hypothesis, we exposed flowers of S. rostratum with varying levels of separation between sexual organs, to bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) of different sizes. We recorded the number of visits received, pollen deposition, and fruit and seed production. We found higher pollen deposition when bees were the same size or bigger than the separation between anther and stigma within a flower. We found a similar, but not statistically significant pattern for fruit set. In contrast, seed set was more likely to occur when the size of the flower exceeded the size of the bee, suggesting that other postpollination processes may be important in translating pollen receipt to seed set. Our results suggest that the fit between flower and pollinator significantly influences pollen deposition in this buzz‐pollinated species. We speculate that in buzz‐pollinated species where floral morphology and pollinators interact closely, variation in the visitor's size may determine whether it acts mainly as a pollinator or as a pollen thief (i.e., removing pollen rewards but contributing little to pollen deposition and fertilization).\\nWe conducted an experimental test with Solanum rostratum, a buzz‐pollinated plant with dimorphic anthers and mirror‐image flowers, to investigate whether the morphological fit between the pollinator's body and floral morphology influences pollen deposition.

Of all the variables analysed, flower colour had the strongest effect on the foraging strategy. Bumblebees searching for blue flowers were more accurate, flew faster, followed more direct paths between flowers and needed less time to find them, than bumblebees searching for red flowers. In turn, training and the presence of odour helped bees to find inconspicuous (red) flowers. When bees foraged on red flowers, search time increased with flower size; but search time was independent of flower size when bees foraged on blue flowers.

The presence of iridescence has been suggested in flowers where diffraction gratings generate iridescent colours. Such colours have been suggested to serve plant–pollinator communication. Here we tested whether a higher iridescence relative to corolla pigmentation would facilitate discrimination, learning and retention of iridescent visual targets. We conditioned bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) to discriminate iridescent from non-iridescent artificial flowers and we varied iridescence detectability by varying target iridescent relative to pigment optical effect. We show that bees rewarded on targets with higher iridescent relative to pigment effect required fewer choices to complete learning, showed faster generalization to novel targets exhibiting the same iridescence-to-pigment level and had better long-term memory retention. Along with optical measurements, behavioural results thus demonstrate that bees can learn iridescence-related cues as bona fide signals for flower reward. They also suggest that floral advertising may be shaped by competition between iridescence and corolla pigmentation, a fact that has important evolutionary implications for pollinators. Optical measurements narrow down the type of cues that bees may have used for learning. Beyond pollinator–plant communication, our experiments help understanding how receivers influence the evolution of iridescence signals generated by gratings.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 29070719\", \"DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2017.1097\", \"ISSN: 1471-2954\", \"ISSN: 0962-8452\", \"EISSN: 1471-2954\"]}\n",

Defense against parasitism is commonly studied in the context of immune system-based mechanisms and, thus, the focus in the search for candidate genes in host-parasite interactions is often on immune genes. In this study, we investigated the association between prevalence of parasite infection and host mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes in two natural populations of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). The two most common haplotypes of the host populations, termed A and B, differ by a single nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution within the coding region of cytochrome oxidase I, an important player in metabolic pathways. We screened infection by Nosema bombi, a common endoparasite of bumblebees, and the corresponding host mtDNA-haplotype frequencies in over 1400 bumblebees between 2000 and 2010. The island population of Gotland showed lower mtDNA diversity compared to the mainland population in Switzerland. Over time, we observed large fluctuations in infection prevalence, as well as variation in host haplotype frequencies in both populations. Our long-term observation revealed that N. bombi infection of specific host genotypes is transient: We found that with increasing infection prevalence, proportionally more individuals with haplotype B, but fewer individuals with haplotype A were infected. This suggests that the presence of N. bombi in specific host genotypes relates to infection prevalence. This may be a result of parasite competition, or differential resilience of host types to ward off infections. The findings highlight the important role of host mtDNA haplotypes in the interaction with parasites.\\n•We screened Nosema bombi infection and mtDNA haplotypes in over 1400 bumblebees.•Infection of specific host genotypes is transient in two bumblebee populations.•With increasing infection prevalence, more B-haplotype hosts were infected.•Reversely, with increasing inf. prevalence, fewer A-haplotype hosts were infected.•This suggests that parasite presence in host haplotypes relates to prevalence.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 29155285\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.meegid.2017.11.019\", \"EISSN: 1567-7257\", \"ISSN: 1567-1348\"]}\n",

In this study, we test the response of flower‐naive bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) toward single and multimodal pollen stimuli as compared to natural dandelion pollen. As artificial pollen stimuli, we used the yellow flavonoid pigment quercetin, the scent compound eugenol, the amino acid proline, the monosaccharide glucose, and the texture of pollen‐grain‐sized glass pellets as a tactile stimulus. Three test stimuli, dandelion pollen, one out of various uni‐ and multimodal stimulus combinations, and a solvent control were presented simultaneously to individual bumblebees, whose response was recorded. The results indicate that bumblebees respond in an irreversible sequence of behavioral reactions. Bumblebees approached the visual stimulus quercetin as often as natural dandelion pollen. An additional olfactory stimulus resulted in slightly more frequent landings. The multimodal stimulus combinations including visual, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile stimuli elicited approaches, antennal contacts, and landings as often as natural pollen. Subsequent reactions like proboscis extension, mandible biting, and buzzing were more often but not regularly observed at dandelion pollen. Our study shows that visual signals of pollen are sufficient to trigger initial responses of bumblebees, whereas multimodal pollen stimuli elicit full behavioral response as compared to natural pollen. Our results suggest a major role of pollen cues for the attraction of bees toward flowers and also explain, why many floral guides mimic the visual signals of pollen and anthers, that is, the yellow and UV‐absorbing color, to direct bumblebees toward the site where they access the floral rewards.\\nBumblebees respond in an irreversible sequence of behavioral reactions to pollen stimuli.

Pesticide exposure has been implicated as a contributor to insect pollinator declines. In social bees, which are crucial pollination service providers, the effect of low-level chronic exposure is typically non-lethal leading researchers to consider whether exposure induces sublethal effects on behaviour and whether such impairment can affect colony development. 2. Studies under laboratory conditions can control levels of pesticide exposure and elucidate causative effects, but are often criticized for being unrealistic. In contrast, field studies can monitor bee responses under a more realistic pesticide exposure landscape; yet typically such findings are limited to correlative results and can lack true controls or sufficient replication. We attempt to bridge this gap by exposing bumblebees to known amounts of pesticides when colonies are placed in the field. 3. Using 20 bumblebee colonies, we assess the consequences of exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin, provided in sucrose at a concentration of five parts per billion, over 5 weeks. We monitored foraging patterns and pollen collecting performance from 3282 bouts using either a non-invasive photographic assessment, or by extracting the pollen from returning foragers. We also conducted a full colony census at the beginning and end of the experiment. 4. In contrast to studies on other neonicotinoids, showing clear impairment to foraging behaviours, we detected only subtle changes to patterns of foraging activity and pollen foraging during the course of the experiment. However, our colony census measures showed a more pronounced effect of exposure, with fewer adult workers and sexuals in treated colonies after 5 weeks. 5. Synthesis and applications. Pesticide-induced impairments on colony development and foraging could impact on the pollination service that bees provide. Therefore, our findings, that bees show subtle changes in foraging behaviour and reductions in colony size after exposure to a common pesticide, have important implications and help to inform the debate over whether the benefits of systemic pesticide application to flowering crops outweigh the costs. We propose that our methodology is an important advance to previous semi-field methods and should be considered when considering improvements to current ecotoxicological guidelines for pesticide risk assessment.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0021-8901\", \"ISSN: 1365-2664\", \"DOI: 10.1111/1365-2664.12792\", \"EISSN: 1365-2664\"]}\n",

In this study, we examined the molecular processes underpinning the behavioral changes that accompany the major life-history transitions in a key pollinator, the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We compared neuro-transcription in queens that succeeded or failed in switching from virgin and immature states, to mated and reproductively mature states. Both successes and failures were associated with distinct molecular profiles, illustrating how development during adulthood triggers distinct molecular profiles within a single caste of a eusocial insect. Failures in both mating and reproductive maturation were explained by a general up-regulation of brain gene transcription. We identified 21 genes that were highly connected in a gene coexpression network analysis: nine genes are involved in neural processes and four are regulators of gene expression. This suggests that negotiating life-history transitions involves significant neural processing and reprogramming, and not just changes in physiology. These findings provide novel insights into basic life-history transitions of an insect. Failure to mate or to become reproductively mature is an overlooked component of variation in natural systems, despite its prevalence in many sexually reproducing organisms, and deserves deeper investigation in the future.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 29087523\", \"EISSN: 1759-6653\", \"ISSN: 1759-6653\", \"DOI: 10.1093/gbe/evx220\"]}\n",

However, most commercial orchards have a limited number of cultivars arranged in monotypic blocks or rows. This can result in insufficient inter-cultivar pollination. We hypothesise that limitations in pollen transfer among cultivars could be explained by both insect behaviour and orchard design. We compared insect activity and pollination efficiency in two European pear cultivars, in orchards with different designs: (i) cultivars alternated in the same row or (ii) cultivars in separate rows. To assess limitations in pollen transfer, we also compared hand pollination with compatible pollen versus open pollination by insects. Insect visitors mainly foraged on neighbouring trees within a row, with few movements across rows (1%). Honey bees (Apis mellifera) and bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) visited significantly more flowers per tree (8.5 vs. 3) and more trees (2.1 vs. 1.3) than solitary bees (Andrena spp.) and hoverflies. Insect visitors deposited large amounts of pollen (∼500 pollen grains) on flower stigmas regardless of the insect type. Cultivar placement affected inter-cultivar pollination; less incompatibility signs were observed when cultivars alternated in the same row (5%) than when cultivars were in separate rows (38%). We observed limitations in pollen transfer as open pollination resulted in significant reduced fruit set, compared with hand pollination, in ‘Conférence’ (21% vs. 30.7%) and ‘Doyenné du Comice’ (7.2% vs. 16.8%). The foraging behaviour of the insects limited thus inter-cultivar pollen transfer in the orchards with cultivars in separate rows. Cultivars used for pollination (pollinizers) should be planted in the same rows as the main cultivar to increase inter-cultivar pollination.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1161-0301\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.eja.2017.09.015\", \"EISSN: 1873-7331\"]}\n",

Multiple anthropogenic pressures may be exacerbating pollinator declines. One key pressure is exposure to chemicals including pesticides and other contaminants. Historically the honey bee (Apis mellifera spp.) has been used as an ‘indicator’ species for ‘standard’ ecotoxicological testing but it has been suggested that it is not always a good proxy for other types of eusocial and solitary bees because of species differences in autecology and sensitivity to various stressors. We developed a common toxicity test system to conduct acute and chronic exposures of up to 240h of similar doses of seven chemicals, targeting different metabolic pathways, on three bee species (Apis mellifera spp., Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis). We compared the relative sensitivity between species in terms of potency between the chemicals and the influence of exposure time on toxicity. While there were significant interspecific differences that varied through time, overall the magnitude of these differences (in terms of treatment effect ratios) was generally comparable (<2 fold) although there were some large divergences from this pattern. Our results suggest that A. mellifera spp. could be used as a proxy for other bee species provided a reasonable assessment factor is used to cover interspecific variation. Perhaps more importantly our results show significant and large time dependency of toxicity across all three tested species that greatly exceeds species differences (>25 fold within test). These are rarely considered in standard regulatory testing but may have severe environmental consequences, especially when coupled with the likelihood of differential species exposures in the wild. These insights indicate that further work is required to understand how differences in toxicokinetics vary between species and mixtures of chemicals.\\n[Display omitted]\\n•Comparison of honey bee susceptibility to toxicants with wild bee species using extended oral exposures•Honey bees are a good proxy for other bee species, provided interspecific variation is accounted for.•DEBtox predicts significant time dependent toxicity differences between bee species.•Temporal changes in toxicity should be incorporated in bee risk assessments.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1879-1026\", \"ISSN: 0048-9697\", \"PMID: 27847190\", \"ISSN: 1879-1026\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.180\"]}\n",

Nonetheless, uncertainties remain about their impact under field conditions. Most studies have been conducted on Apis mellifera and tested single compounds. However, in agricultural environments, bees are often exposed to multiple pesticides. We explore the synergistic mortality between a neonicotinoid (clothianidin) and an ergosterol‐biosynthesis‐inhibiting fungicide (propiconazole) in three bee species (A. mellifera, Bombus terrestris, Osmia bicornis) following oral exposure in the laboratory.RESULTSWe developed a new approach based on the binomial proportion test to analyse synergistic interactions. We estimated uptake of clothianidin per foraging bout in honey bees foraging on seed‐coated rapeseed fields. We found significant synergistic mortality in all three bee species exposed to non‐lethal doses of propiconazole and their respective <jats:styled-content style=\\\"fixed-case\\\">LD10</jats:styled-content> of clothianidin. Significant synergism was only found at the first assessment times in A. mellifera (4 and 24 h) and B. terrestris (4 h), but persisted throughout the experiment (96 h) in O. bicornis. O. bicornis was also the most sensitive species to clothianidin.CONCLUSIONOur results underscore the importance to test pesticide combinations likely to occur in agricultural environments, and to include several bee species in environmental risk assessment schemes. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 27685544\", \"EISSN: 1526-4998\", \"DOI: 10.1002/ps.4449\", \"ISSN: 1526-498X\", \"ISSN: 1526-4998\"]}\n",

Natural and anthropogenic stressors threaten the sustainability of bumble bees and evaluating their impact is essential to the stewardship of these valuable pollinators. Demographic modelling provides a framework for testing hypotheses about the impacts of stressors, but it has not previously been applied to bumble bees.2. I therefore formulated a demographic model for a bumble bee colony and then quantified the impact of two stressors, pesticide exposure and spider predation, by perturbing it with their known effects.3. By simulating a laboratory exposure ofBombus terrestrisL. to dietary imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid insecticide), I tested whether the observed colony decline was explained solely by a toxic effect on the fecundity of the foundress queen. By simulating field observations ofB. terricolaKirby, I tested whether predation by crab spiders reduced colony fitness sufficiently to provide an adaptive explanation for avoidance behaviours seen when bumble bees encounter spiders.4. InB. terrestris, a dose‐appropriate decrease in fecundity predicted the observed colony decline, which implicates this as a principal mechanism of toxicity. InB. terricola, doubling the rate of spider predation reduced a colony's production of new queens by 11%, which implies that spider avoidance is highly adaptive.5. These analyses illustrate the utility of demographic modelling for quantifying the impacts of stressors on bumble bees. In the future, models of this type could be used to investigate a wider range of stressors and to produce thereby knowledge and tools useful for safeguarding bumble bees and the pollination services that they provide.\", \"identifier\": [\"CODEN: EENTDT\", \"ISSN: 0307-6946\", \"ISSN: 1365-2311\", \"DOI: 10.1111/een.12376\", \"EISSN: 1365-2311\"]}\n",

Here we aimed to develop and test a quick and easy method for sterile and contamination-free hemolymph sampling from adult Apidae. Our novel antennae method for hemolymph sampling (AMHS), entailed the detachment of an antenna, followed by application of delicate pressure to the bee's abdomen. This resulted in the appearance of a drop of hemolymph at the base of the detached antenna, which was then aspirated using an automatic pipetter. Larger insect size corresponded to easier and faster hemolymph sampling, and to a greater sample volume. We obtained 80-100 μL of sterile non-melanized hemolymph in 1 minute from one Bombus terrestris worker, in 6 minutes from 10 Apis mellifera workers, and in 15 minutes from 18 Apis cerana workers (+/-0.5 minutes). Compared to the most popular method of hemolymph collection, in which hemolymph is sampled by puncturing the dorsal sinus of the thorax with a capillary (TCHS), significantly fewer bees were required to collect 80-100 μL hemolymph using our novel AMHS method. Moreover, the time required for hemolymph collection was significantly shorter using the AMHS compared to the TCHS, which protects the acquired hemolymph against melanization, thus providing the highest quality material for biological analysis.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 28125668\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0170487\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

To provide a tool for projecting and testing sensitivity of growth of populations under contrasting and combined pressures, we propose a delay differential equation model that describes multi-colony bumble bee population dynamics. We explain the usefulness of delay equations as a natural modeling formulation, particularly for bumble bee modeling. We then introduce a particular numerical method that approximates the solution of the delay model. Next, we provide simulations of seasonal population dynamics in the absence of pressures. We conclude by describing ways in which resource limitation, pesticide exposure and other pressures can be reflected in the model.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1872-7026\", \"ISSN: 1872-7026\", \"ISSN: 0304-3800\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.02.011\"]}\n",

This constitutes the first study to report on the use of high-intensity pulsed light (PL) for the inactivation of the trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi, a pest of wild and managed bees. Through initial PL range-finding studies we identified a putative effective UV dose of 12.96 μJ/cm\\n2\\nfor C. bombi treatment. This was a result of tests on waterborne protozoan Cryptosporidium parvum, and was determined using in vitro combined cell culture-qPCR infectivity assays.

To confirm this dose as appropriate for treatment of C. bombi, we used the buff tailed bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) as an animal infectivity model. C. bombi was collected from the feces of wild B. terrestris queens and used to inoculate 30 commercially supplied workers (B. terrestris audux) in order to obtain a colony-specific C. bombi inoculum. This was used for subsequent tests on 60 randomly-selected unparasitised workers, which were divided evenly and fed either PL-treated or untreated (control) C. bombi inoculant. Of the 28 surviving workers fed with pooled C. bombi untreated inoculum, 25 exhibited infection as confirmed by detection of the parasite in fecal samples after 9 days, where the remaining two did not excrete feces. Twenty-eight of 30 (93%) workers fed PL-treated C. bombi at 12.96 μJ/cm\\n2\\nunder similar test conditions were uninfected after the same time period (the remaining two workers did not produce feces for testing). Thus we demonstrate for the first time, that PL is potentially a reliable and efficient technology for the non-thermal inactivation of C. bombi for the pollination industry. Although in vivo treatment of whole bees with PL is not possible, the use of this technology on equipment used in commercial bumble bee breeding facilities could potentially reduce infection rates, therefore contributing to making the industry more sustainable and less of a risk to wild pollinators.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0021-8839\", \"DOI: 10.1080/00218839.2017.1289668\", \"EISSN: 2078-6913\"]}\n",

Using whole-brain immunolabelling, we measured the density of microglomeruli in the collar region (visual association areas) of the mushroom bodies of the bumblebee brain. We found that bumblebees which made fewer errors during training in a visual discrimination task had higher microglomerular density. Similarly, bumblebees that had better retention of the learned colour-reward associations two days after training had higher microglomerular density. Further experiments indicated experience-dependent changes in neural circuitry: learning a colour-reward contingency with 10 colours (but not two colours) does result, and exposure to many different colours may result, in changes to microglomerular density in the collar region of the mushroom bodies. These results reveal the varying roles that visual experience, visual learning and foraging activity have on neural structure.

Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct estimates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (Drosophila: 2.8 × 10\\nper bp per haploid genome per generation; Heliconius: 2.9 × 10\\n) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10\\n). Might the honeybee's rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct estimate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we estimate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10\\nper haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10\\nand 5.37 × 10\\n) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences.

Plants divert substantial resources to produce nectar that attracts pollinators [3], but toxins in this reward could disrupt the mutualism and reduce plant fitness [4]. Alternatively, such compounds could protect nectar from robbers [2], provided that they do not significantly alter pollinator visitation to the detriment of plant fitness [1, 5–8]. Indeed, very few studies have investigated the role of plant toxins in nectar for defense against nectar robbers [4, 9, 10]. Here, we compared two Aconitum species (A. napellus and A. lycoctonum) that have flowers specialized for long-tongued bumblebee pollinators (Bombus hortorum) but are occasionally robbed by short-tongued bumblebees (B. terrestris) [6, 11–13]. Pollinator visits to flowers were much more frequent than by robbers, but visits correlated negatively with nectar alkaloid concentration and declined sharply between 200 and 380 ppm. However, alkaloid concentrations of >20 ppm were deterrent to B. terrestris, suggesting that robbers were less tolerant of nectar alkaloids. Nectar of both plant species contained similar concentrations of carbohydrates and toxic alkaloids, but A. lycoctonum was more likely to secrete nectar in each flower and was also visited more frequently by pollinators and robbers. We conclude that alkaloids in Aconitum spp. nectar affect rates of both pollinator visitation and robbery but may have co-evolved with nectar availability to maintain the fitness benefits of specialized plant-pollinator relationships. Chemical defense of nectar is, however, ultimately constrained by pollinator gustatory sensitivity.\\n•Aconitum nectar alkaloids function as a defense against nectar robbing bumblebees•Nectar alkaloids are more distasteful to nectar robbers than pollinating bees•Pollinators are also deterred from feeding on Aconitum flowers with nectar alkaloids•Nectar toxins function as a defense when floral nectar is infrequently encountered\\nBarlow et al. show that nectar alkaloids in specialized Aconitum flowers deter nectar-robbing bumblebees.

They are proposed to be responsive in relation to environmental challenges including the nutritional status, bacterial and viral infections. The SVC protein Vago acts as a cross-talk molecule between the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway and the Jak/STAT pathway upon viral infection in Drosophila melanogaster and Culex mosquito cells. Unlike flies and mosquitoes that possess diverse SVCs, most bee species only have one of which the function remains unclear. Here we investigated whether this single SVC within the genome of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris is also involved in the host antiviral immunity and whether links with other immune pathways can be found. We can show the presence of two key characteristics of Vago linked with the single SVC in B. terrestris (BtSVC). The antiviral character is proven by silencing BtSVC, which lead to increased Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) levels in the fat body. Second, the silencing of BtDicer-2 resulted in a lower expression of BtSVC and increased IAPV levels, confirming the link between Dicer-2 and BtSVC. We were, however, unable to demonstrate a third known role of Vago in the activation of the Jak/STAT pathway. This is probably because we lack good markers for this pathway in bumblebees. Interestingly, we found that BtSVC contributes to the basal expression levels of four antimicrobial peptide (AMP)-coding genes in the fat body of the bumblebees. Therefore, the single SVC gene in bumblebees may be involved in both host antiviral immunity and basal AMPs expression.\\n[Display omitted]\\n•In the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, silencing BtSVC resulted in increased Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) level.•Silencing BtDicer-2 resulted in lower BtSVC expression and increased IAPV level.•BtSVC is also involved in the basal expression of AMP genes.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1879-0240\", \"ISSN: 0965-1748\", \"PMID: 29074090\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.ibmb.2017.10.002\"]}\n",

Various insects may be pollinators, but the main one is the honey bee [HB] (Apis mellifera). However, despite the advantages of the honey bee as pollinator of many plants, it is a relatively inefficient pollinator of apple flowers. The main reason for this is the tendency of HBs to visit the apple flower from the side (sideworker), thus “stealing” nectar without touching the flower’s reproductive organs – stamens and stigma. In contrast, a bee that visits the flower from the top (topworker) contacts the flower’s reproductive organs, which results in better pollination. Due to the low pollination efficiency, few seeds are formed, and often the resulting fruit is too small to be of commercial value. Experiments conducted in Israel over the last few years have shown for the first time that adding bumblebees [BB] (Bombus terrestris) into pear orchards improved cross-pollination, thus increasing the number of seeds and subsequently fruit size. The goal of the present work was to test the hypothesis that adding BBs to apple orchards may improve cross-pollination. We found that adding BBs to the HBs in the apple orchard improved pollination in all tested cultivars, especially in ‘Gala’, which naturally suffers from relatively few seeds in the fruit. It appears that the addition of BBs did not only increase the number of pollinating insects in the orchard that could perform cross-pollination, including in the cool mornings and in adverse weather conditions, but that it also changed HB foraging behavior, which resulted in improved cross-pollination and increased efficiency, and subsequently more seeds and larger fruit. The improved pollination was due to the greater mobility of HBs between rows of pollinated cultivar and pollenizer, and to the greater proportion of topworkers, which are more efficient pollinators.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0304-4238\", \"EISSN: 1879-1018\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.scienta.2017.03.010\"]}\n",

In this study, we took advantage of the reproductive plasticity of workers to test the causal role of reproduction in determining longevity in eusocial insects. Using the eusocial bumblebee Bombus terrestris, we found that, in whole colonies, in which workers could freely ‘choose’ whether to become reproductive, workers' level of ovarian activation was significantly positively associated with longevity and ovary-active workers significantly outlived ovary-inactive workers. By contrast, when reproductivity was experimentally induced in randomly selected workers, thereby decoupling it from other traits, workers' level of ovarian activation was significantly negatively associated with longevity and ovary-active workers were significantly less long-lived than ovary-inactive workers. These findings show that workers experience costs of reproduction and suggest that intrinsically high-quality individuals can overcome these costs.

The <jats:styled-content style=\\\"fixed-case\\\">MB</jats:styled-content>‐core subpopulation was recently shown to express the transcription factor FoxP with relevance for decision‐making. Here, we report the development and adult distribution of a FoxP‐expressing neuron population in the <jats:styled-content style=\\\"fixed-case\\\">MB</jats:styled-content> of honeybees (Apis mellifera, Am) using in situ hybridisation and a custom‐made antiserum. We found the same expression pattern in adult bumblebees (Bombus terrestris, Bt). We also designed a new Dm transgenic line that reports FoxP transcriptional activity in the <jats:styled-content style=\\\"fixed-case\\\">MB</jats:styled-content>‐core region, clarifying previously conflicting data of two other reporter lines. Considering developmental, anatomical and molecular similarities, our data are consistent with the concept of deep homology of FoxP expression in neuron populations coding reinforcement‐based learning and habit formation.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 28921711\", \"EISSN: 1460-9568\", \"ISSN: 0953-816X\", \"DOI: 10.1111/ejn.13713\"]}\n",

Using model flowers with discrete spot or bullseye ring patterns we investigate the responses of\\nBombus terrestris\\nforagers towards rewarding and unrewarding flowers. We find that the presence of petal spots and rings reduce the search time of pollinators to locate rewarding model flowers. Only the rewarding petal ring phenotype, however, is readily learned and significantly increases the foraging efficiency of experienced bees over four foraging bouts. Although the rewarding spot phenotype induces random foraging over this time frame, employing differential conditioning with a strong aversive stimulus over ten foraging bouts reveal that bees have the capacity to correctly identify rewarding spot phenotypes with more training. Once a strong association between petal marking and reward is formed, bees continue to respond to marked phenotypes even when unrewarding, suggesting rewardless plants that exhibit petal marking could potentially exploit their pollinators. We conclude that petal marking, whether organised discretely in a spot or in a continuous ring around the centre of a flower, have a significant and complex influence on pollinator foraging dynamics.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1573-8477\", \"ISSN: 0269-7653\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s10682-016-9852-5\"]}\n",

Past research has tended to investigate the impacts of these stressors in isolation, despite the increasing recognition that bees are simultaneously exposed to a combination of stressors, with potentially additive or synergistic effects. No studies to date have investigated the combined effects of a monotonous diet and exposure to pesticides. Using queenless micro-colonies of Bombus terrestris audax, we examined this interaction by providing bees with monofloral or polyfloral pollen that was either contaminated with field-realistic levels of thiamethoxam, a commonly used neonicotinoid, or not contaminated. Both treatments were found to have a significant effect on various parameters relating to micro-colony performance. Specifically, both pesticide-treated micro-colonies and those fed monofloral pollen grew more slowly than those given polyfloral pollen or pollen without pesticides. The two factors appeared to act additively. Micro-colonies given monofloral pollens also exhibited lower reproductive efforts and produced smaller drones. Although further research is needed to examine whether similar effects are found in whole colonies, these findings increase our understanding of the likely effects of multiple stressors associated with agricultural intensification on bee declines.\\n•Bumblebee microcolonies grow better when fed on a mixture of pollens.•Microcolonies exposed to thiamethoxam grow more slowly.•Poor diet and pesticide exposure act additively on bumblebee colony fitness.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.01.041\", \"PMID: 28135666\", \"ISSN: 0147-6513\", \"EISSN: 1090-2414\"]}\n",

Floral nectar is a key resource for pollinators, whereas extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) support indirect plant defense.

Herbivory has been shown to induce changes in the multimodal display and in resource related characteristics of flowers and EFNs. This may consequently affect the behavior of nectar consumers such as pollinators that occasionally feed on extrafloral nectar in addition to floral nectar. We tested the effect of herbivory (simulated by jasmonic acid treatment) on olfactory, visual and resource related floral and EFN traits in\\nVicia faba\\n, tracked alterations in bumblebee (\\nBombus terrestris\\n) preference and evaluated potential outcomes for plant reproduction. In control plants, flowers and EFNs differed in olfactory and visual cues and also in nectar quantity and quality and pollinators clearly preferred to forage on flowers. After jasmonic acid treatment (JA), linalool emissions of EFNs increased in a large proportion of plants, the visual display of EFNs became more salient and nectar volumes increased. In flowers of JA-treated plants we found lower emissions of cinnamic aldehyde and lower sugar concentration in nectar, however visual cues were unaffected. Potentially because of these phenotypic changes bumblebees no longer preferred flowers over EFNs in JA-treated plants. Consequently, this may negatively affect reproductive success in\\nV. faba\\n, which is highly dependent on floral visitation for fruit set. Our study adds another aspect to the complexity of plant–pollinator interactions and reveals how herbivory may interfere with plant–pollinator communication.

Furthermore, bees with better learning abilities foraged for fewer days; suggesting a cost of enhanced learning performance in the wild.

Clothianidin toxicity showed a small scale, but temporally conserved increase in exposure conducted in the presence of propiconazole, particularly for B. terrestris and O. bicornis, the latter showing a near three-fold increase in clothianidin toxicity in the presence of propiconazole. In the mixture toxicity studies, the dominant response patterns were of additivity, however, binary mixtures of clothianidin and dimethoate in A. mellifera, B. terrestris and male O. bicornis there was evidence of a predominant antagonistic interaction. Given the ubiquitous nature of exposures to multiple chemicals, there is an urgent need to consider mixture effects in pollinator risk assessments.

Here, we determine the combined benefit (forage) and cost (insecticide) of oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam-treated seeds on Bombus terrestris and Apis mellifera colonies. In April 2014, 36 colonies per species were located adjacent to three large oilseed rape fields (12 colonies per field). Another 36 were in three nearby locations in the same agro-ecosystem, but several kilometers distant from any oilseed rape fields. We found that Bombus colony growth and reproduction were unaffected by location (distant versus adjacent) following the two month flowering period. Apis colony and queen survival were unaffected. However, there was a small, but significant, negative relationship between honey and pollen neonicotinoid contamination and Apis colony weight gain.

But how reproduction affects longevity in eusocial insects has rarely been tested experimentally. In this study, we took advantage of the reproductive plasticity of workers to test the causal role of reproduction in determining longevity in eusocial insects. Using the eusocial bumblebee Bombus terrestris, we found that, in whole colonies, in which workers could freely 'choose' whether to become reproductive, workers' level of ovarian activation was significantly positively associated with longevity and ovary-active workers significantly outlived ovary–inactive workers. By contrast, when reproductivity was experimentally induced in randomly selected workers, thereby decoupling it from other traits, workers' level of ovarian activation was significantly negatively associated with longevity and ovary-active workers were significantly less long-lived than ovaryinactive workers. These findings show that workers experience costs of reproduction and suggest that intrinsically high-quality individuals can overcome these costs. They also raise the possibility that eusocial insect queens exhibit condition-dependent longevity and hence call into question whether eusociality entails a truly reversed fecundity–longevity trade-off involving a fundamental remodelling of conserved genetic and endocrine networks underpinning ageing.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0962-8452\", \"EISSN: 1471-2954\"]}\n",

Maintenance of the proper gradients for essential ions across cellular membranes makes P-ATPases crucial for cell survival. In this study, characterization of two families of P-ATPases including P-ATPase 13A1 and P-ATPase 13A3 protein was compared in two different insect species from different orders.

Seven different insect species from 13A1 and five samples from 13A3 family were selected as the representative samples for functional and structural analyses. The structural and functional analyses were performed with ProtParam, SOPMA, SignalP 4.1, TMHMM 2.0, ProtScale and ProDom tools in the ExPASy database.

As bees exclusively rely on pollen for development and survival, such declines could be partly related to changes in their host plant abundance and quality. Here, we investigate whether generalist bumblebee species, with stable population trends over the past years, adapted their diets in response to changes in the distribution and chemical quality of their pollen resources. We selected five common species of bumblebee in NW Europe for which we had a precise description of their pollen diet through two time periods (‘prior to 1950’ and ‘2004–2005’). For each species, we assessed whether the shift in their pollen diet was related with the changes in the suitable area of their pollen resources. Concurrently, we evaluated whether the chemical composition of pollen resources changed over time and experimentally tested the impact of new major pollen species on the development of B. terrestris microcolonies. Only one species (i.e. B. lapidarius) significantly included more pollen from resources whose suitable area expanded. This opportunist pattern could partly explain the expansion of B. lapidarius in Europe. Regarding the temporal variation in the chemical composition of the pollen diet, total and essential amino acid contents did not differ significantly between the two time periods while we found significant differences among plant species. This result is driven by the great diversity of resources used by bumblebee species in both periods. Our bioassay revealed that the shift to new major pollen resources allowed microcolonies to develop, bringing new evidence on the opportunist feature of bumblebee in their diets. Overall, this study shows that the response to pollen resource drift varies among closely related pollinators, and a species‐rich plant community ensures generalist species to select a nutrient‐rich pollen diet.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1111/gcb.13373\", \"EISSN: 1365-2486\", \"ISSN: 1354-1013\", \"PMID: 27234488\", \"ISSN: 1365-2486\"]}\n",

We assessed the proportion of robbed buds, and nectar availability in flowers and buds (robbed and non-robbed) in 16 raspberry fields along gradients of bumble bee and honey bee abundance in NW Patagonia, Argentina. We also measured nectar production and replenishment in flowers that developed from robbed and non-robbed buds in one experimental field. Across fields, the proportion of robbed buds increased with the abundance of bumble bees, but not of honey bees. At anthesis, flowers from buds that were robbed once contained half the nectar, and produced two thirds of the nectar compared to those flowers that had not been robbed. Therefore, high abundance of invasive bumble bees can reduce resources for managed honey bees by robbing flower buds. This study reveals a novel, negative impact of bumble bee invasions that could potentially affect honey production.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1439-1791\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.baae.2017.01.001\", \"ISSN: 1618-0089\"]}\n",

A bumblebee colony requires pollen and nectar throughout its lifetime, but degraded and fragmented habitats may have gaps in the temporal and spatial continuity of floral resources.Heathlands are open biotopes that provide favourable habitat for bumblebees like Bombus jonellus, a declining species in Belgium. In heathlands, ericaceous species are the main plants that provide pollen and nectar for bumblebees. Although the nectar composition of ericaceous species has been previously studied, data on pollen composition remain scarce.We examined bumblebee diets (composition of their pollen loads) in Belgian heathlands over the course of a colony lifetime to assess the fidelity of bumblebees for ericaceous species. We compared nutritional values by investigating the chemical composition (amino acids, polypeptides and sterols) of the pollen of the ericaceous and dominant non‐ericaceous species present in pollen loads. No relationship was detected between the abundance of a particular plant species in bumblebee loads and its pollen composition.The successive flowering periods and the nutritional quality of pollen of ericaceous species offer valuable resources for bumblebees. Ericaceous species represent a large part of bumblebee diets in heathlands, especially in early spring and late summer when the diversity of other flowering species was low.Bumblebee pollen loads also contained non‐ericaceous flowering species that grow outside heathlands. Thus, land planning must incorporate conservation strategies for the different elements of the landscape matrix, including heathlands, peatlands, meadows and margins.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1752-4598\", \"DOI: 10.1111/icad.12201\", \"ISSN: 1752-458X\", \"EISSN: 1752-4598\"]}\n",

Using a matrix of 36 phytochemical treatment combinations, we assessed the combined effects of two floral phytochemicals, eugenol and thymol, against four strains of the bumblebee gut trypanosome Crithidia bombi. Eugenol and thymol had synergistic effects against C. bombi growth across seven independent experiments, showing that the phytochemical combination can disproportionately inhibit parasites.

Floral colour change (FCC), reported in hundreds of species, is a well‐known example of honest signalling in plant–pollinator interactions. It occurs in fully turgid flowers, and usually correlates with a cessation of reward production in individual flowers. This trait has been considered a plant strategy that enhances distant pollinator attraction by extended displays, while minimizing visits to non‐reproductive flowers by honest colour signals.\\nHere, we propose an additional, overlooked benefit of FCC, which emerges when we consider the spatial learning ability of pollinators to avoid unprofitable plants. If a plant retains rewardless flowers without FCC, it is difficult for pollinators to visually locate the rewarding flowers. Although the enhanced display initially attracts more pollinators, its low profitability for foraging may cause plant‐level avoidance by them. The avoidance resulting from rewardless flower retention may be prevented by FCC because it helps pollinators to find rewarding flowers. To test this hypothesis, we observed the behavioural changes of bumblebees foraging in an array of artificial plants.\\nWe found that rewardless flowers without FCC could initially attract bees by increasing the plant's display size, but their lack of reward resulted in plant‐level avoidance by those bees with spatial memories. The FCC in rewardless flowers, in contrast, encouraged bees to return by helping them to find rewards on plants. Consequently, honest plants with FCC received more visits than those dishonest plants that did not display colour change.\\nFloral colour change thus can prevent plant‐level avoidance by pollinators that use spatial memory when choosing plants. The spatial learning ability of pollinators may, therefore, be one of the keys to understanding why both colour‐changing and non‐colour‐changing plant species occur among angiosperms.\\nA lay summary is available for this article.\\nLay Summary\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1365-2435\", \"ISSN: 0269-8463\", \"DOI: 10.1111/1365-2435.12802\", \"EISSN: 1365-2435\"]}\n",

Although many phytochemicals act as toxins and deterrents to consumers, the same chemicals may counteract disease and be preferred by infected individuals. The roles of nectar and pollen phytochemicals in pollinator ecology and conservation are complex, with evidence for both toxicity and medicinal effects against parasites. However, it remains unclear how consistent the effects of phytochemicals are across different parasite lineages and environmental conditions, and whether pollinators actively self-medicate with these compounds when infected.\\nHere, we test effects of the nectar alkaloid anabasine, found in Nicotiana, on infection intensity, dietary preference, and survival and performance of bumble bees (Bombus impatiens). We examined variation in the effects of anabasine on infection with different lineages of the intestinal parasite Crithidia under pollen-fed and pollen-starved conditions.\\nWe found that anabasine did not reduce infection intensity in individual bees infected with any of four Crithidia lineages that were tested in parallel, nor did anabasine reduce infection intensity in microcolonies of queenless workers. In addition, neither anabasine nor its isomer, nicotine, was preferred by infected bees in choice experiments, and infected bees consumed less anabasine than did uninfected bees under no-choice conditions. Furthermore, anabasine exacerbated the negative effects of infection on bee survival and microcolony performance. Anabasine reduced infection in only one experiment, in which bees were deprived of pollen and post-pupal contact with nestmates. In this experiment, anabasine had antiparasitic effects in bees from only two of four colonies, and infected bees exhibited reduced-rather than increased-phytochemical consumption relative to uninfected bees.\\nVariation in the effect of anabasine on infection suggests potential modulation of tritrophic interactions by both host genotype and environmental variables. Overall, our results demonstrate that Bombus impatiens prefer diets without nicotine and anabasine, and suggest that the medicinal effects and toxicity of anabasine may be context dependent.

In bumble bees, CO2 narcosis causes queens to bypass diapause and initiate egg laying, but its mode of action is not well-understood. Here, we evaluated the effects of CO2 narcosis on the behavior, physiology and immune function of virgin bumble bee queens (Bombus impatiens). We tested the hypothesis that CO2 induces these changes by stimulating oxidative stress response pathways. We found that CO2 stimulates ovarian activation and egg production and suppresses lipid (but not glycogen) accumulation in virgin queens. Additionally, CO2 treated queens were more active (particularly in terms of flight) and performed, but did not receive, more aggressive behaviors compared to controls. Moreover, CO2 positively affected immune function in queens, reduced transcript levels of 5/6 antioxidant enzyme genes and had no effect on longevity. Thus, although CO2 treatment stimulated reproduction, we did not observe any evidence of a trade-off in queen health parameters, aside from a reduction in lipids. Overall CO2 narcosis does not appear to stimulate a typical stress response in virgin bumble bee queens. On the contrary, CO2 narcosis appears to stimulate changes that prepare queens to cope with the nutritional, metabolic and behavioral challenges associated with reproduction and colony-founding.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0022-1910\", \"EISSN: 1879-1611\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.06.014\"]}\n",

Visual capabilities of bees have been extensively studied mostly using artificial paper models. However, there is no empirical determination of the maximal detection distance (MDD) or minimal subtended visual angle (MSVA) of real flowers. Using a six armed radial maze, we tested MDD and MSVA of 12 types of natural and manipulated real flowers by bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) workers. Bees were initially trained to obtain sugar solution at target flowers that were presented at close range on a mobile divider at the back of one of the six arms. Bees were individually marked and tested. For bees that passed the short range test, we gradually increased the distance of the target flower, until the number of successful choices reached chance level, indicating that they could not see the target flowers. The results show that MSVA of flowers is correlated with flower diameter but not with MDD. The variation in MDD to natural flowers by bumble bee workers can be best predicted by: MDD = flower coloured area / (contour line * green contrast). Contour line length determines flower dissectedness. Full circular flowers can be detected from longer distance than dissected flowers with identical diameter. We hypothesize that dissected flower shapes might be compensated by their higher attractiveness for bees. Empirical determination of real flower MDD and MSVA is important for studying bee foraging behaviour, pollinator induced evolution of flower traits and validation of neurophysiological visual models.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1920-7603\", \"ISSN: 1920-7603\", \"DOI: 10.26786/1920-7603(2017)one\"]}\n",

We recorded all flower visitation sequences performed by 29 bees tested for 20 consecutive foraging bouts in three experimental arrays, each characterised by a unique spatial configuration of artificial flowers and three-dimensional landmarks. All bees started to develop efficient routes as they accumulated foraging experience in each array, and showed consistent inter-individual differences in their levels of route fidelity and foraging performance, as measured by travel speed and the frequency of revisits to flowers. While the tendency of bees to repeat the same route was influenced by their colony origin, foraging performance was correlated to body size.

In this study, we examined floral trait variation within cultivated sunflowers and its effects on bee foraging behaviours. Over 2 years, we planted different sunflower inbred lines, including male‐fertile and male‐sterile lines, and measured nectar volume, nectar sugar concentration and composition, and corolla length. During bloom, we recorded visits by both managed honey bees and wild bees. We then examined consistency in relative nectar production by comparing field results to those from a greenhouse experiment. Sunflower inbred lines varied significantly in all floral traits, including the amount and composition of nectar sugars, and in corolla length. Both wild bee and honey bee visits significantly increased with nectar sugar amount and decreased with corolla length, but appeared unaffected by nectar sugar composition. While wild bees made more visits to sunflowers providing pollen (male‐fertile), honey bees preferred plants without pollen (male‐sterile). Differences in nectar quantity among greenhouse‐grown sunflower lines were similar to those measured in the field, and bumble bees preferentially visited lines with more nectar in greenhouse observations. Our results show that sunflowers with greater quantities of nectar sugar and shorter corollas receive greater pollination services from both managed and wild bees. Selecting for these traits could thus increase sunflower crop yields and provide greater floral resources for bees.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1439-0418\", \"DOI: 10.1111/jen.12375\", \"ISSN: 0931-2048\"]}\n",

However, the conditions promoting the existence of such systems are still an enigma. We suggest that by focusing on floral similarity between model and mimic, reward levels offered by models, and pollinators’ ability to adjust foraging accordingly, the conditions can be better understood. Using spatially‐explicit modelling, we examined trait combinations that lead to the survival of deceptive species under a large range of mimic strategies, from Batesian mimicry to general food deception. Unlike previous models studying such systems, we examined model–mimic interactions in the presence of a third, dissimilar species, thus generating a more realistic scenario where pollinators may avoid the model–mimic system altogether. Results showed that overall survival and abundance of species in food deceptive systems depend on the relative reward provided by the participating species and the potential alternatives available. Specifically, the success of a mimic in a Batesian mimicry system depends on high levels of reward provided by its model species relative to potential alternatives in the flower community. On the other hand, the success of a mimic in a general food deception system was higher when the reward offered was lower. Our study suggests that the ability of pollinators to utilize their experience as part of decision‐making is highly relevant in promoting mimic survival, thus shedding light on the conditions under which food deception is expected.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0030-1299\", \"EISSN: 1600-0706\", \"DOI: 10.1111/oik.04268\"]}\n",

The presence of iridescence has been suggested in flowers where diffraction gratings generate iridescent colours. Such colours have been suggested to serve plant-pollinator communication. Here we tested whether a higher iridescence relative to corolla pigmentation would facilitate discrimination, learning and retention of iridescent visual targets. We conditioned bumblebees (Bambus terrestris) to discriminate iridescent from non-iridescent artificial flowers and we varied iridescence detectability by varying target iridescent relative to pigment optical effect. We show that bees rewarded on targets with higher iridescent relative to pigment effect required fewer choices to complete learning, showed faster generalization to novel targets exhibiting the same iridescence-to-pigment level and had better long-term memory retention. Along with optical measurements, behavioural results thus demonstrate that bees can learn iridescence-related cues as bona fide signals for flower reward. They also suggest that floral advertising may be shaped by competition between iridescence and corolla pigmentation, a fact that has important evolutionary implications for pollinators. Optical measurements narrow down the type of cues that bees may have used for learning. Beyond pollinatorplant communication, our experiments help understanding how receivers influence the evolution of iridescence signals generated by gratings.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0962-8452\", \"EISSN: 1471-2954\"]}\n",

Concurrent larval rearing studies found novaluron and NMP to be toxic to developing honey bees at doses as low as 100 ppb and 100 ppm, respectively. Nucleus colony feeding studies found that chronic exposure to Rimon 0.83EC at doses as low as 200 ppm (18.6 ppm novaluron) can result in interruptions to brood production that can last for up to 2 wk after exposure.Taken together, these data indicate the use of Rimon 0.83EC on blooming flowers is a significant threat to honey bee reproduction, and suggest the need for more strict and clear usage guidelines.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1093/jee/tox220\", \"ISSN: 0022-0493\", \"EISSN: 1938-291X\", \"PMID: 28961741\"]}\n",

The degree of connectivity implies using alternative conservation prioritizations based on the appropriate spatial scale for management units. In species with low population connectivity, it is important to preserve local populations in order to maintain the species throughout its range. In contrast, species with high connectivity require extensive management aiming at preserving gene flow through the entire species range. Here we examine at the continental scale the relationship between inter-population/inter-individual genetic and geographical distances to study the isolation-by-distance (IBD) pattern within the European range of nine wild bee species. We then assess the suitability of multi-local or extensive conservation to ensure their long-term survival. Results based on inter-population differences show only two out of nine species with significant IBD. European bee populations seem quite connected when their IBD is compared to IBD of other phyla. However, our results based on inter-individual distances show that eight out of nine species display significant IBD. These different results are presumably a consequence of potential limitations of the inter-population approach. Therefore, we speculate that the inter-population approach could result in inaccurate IBD estimations. This approach should therefore be replaced by the inter-individual approach in order to provide strong supported conservation guidelines.

In this study, we investigated the entire angiosperm flora of the Alps with regard to visually displayed pollen and floral guides. All species were checked for the presence of pollen- and stamen-imitating structures using colour photographs. Most flowering plants of the Alps display yellow pollen and at least 28% of the species display pollen- or stamen-imitating structures. The most frequent types of pollen and stamen imitations were (mostly yellow and UV-absorbing) colour patches on petals (65% of species displaying imitations), patterns of inflorescences (18%), stamen-like pistils (10%), and staminodes (6%), as well as three-dimensional structures such as convex lower lips and filamental hairs (<5%). Dichogamous and diclinous species display pollen- and stamen-imitating structures more often than non-dichogamous and non-diclinous species, respectively.

In practice, the subjective study of natural stimuli has been permitted by perceptual spaces, which are graphical models of how stimuli are perceived by a given animal. Because colour vision is arguably the best‐known sensory modality in most animals, a diversity of colour spaces are now available to visual ecologists, ranging from generalist and basic models allowing rough but robust predictions on colour perception, to species‐specific, more complex models giving accurate but context‐dependent predictions. Selecting among these models is most often influenced by historical contingencies that have associated models to specific questions and organisms; however, these associations are not always optimal. The aim of this review is to provide visual ecologists with a critical perspective on how models of colour space are built, how well they perform and where their main limitations are with regard to their most frequent uses in ecology and evolutionary biology. We propose a classification of models based on their complexity, defined as whether and how they model the mechanisms of chromatic adaptation and receptor opponency, the nonlinear association between the stimulus and its perception, and whether or not models have been fitted to experimental data. Then, we review the effect of modelling these mechanisms on predictions of colour detection and discrimination, colour conspicuousness, colour diversity and diversification, and for comparing the perception of colour traits between distinct perceivers. While a few rules emerge (e.g. opponent log–linear models should be preferred when analysing very distinct colours), in general model parameters still have poorly known effects. Colour spaces have nonetheless permitted significant advances in ecology and evolutionary biology, and more progress is expected if ecologists compare results between models and perform behavioural experiments more routinely. Such an approach would further contribute to a better understanding of colour vision and its links to the behavioural ecology of animals. While visual ecology is essentially a transfer of knowledge from visual sciences to evolutionary ecology, we hope that the discipline will benefit both fields more evenly in the future.\", \"identifier\": [\"CODEN: BRCPAH\", \"EISSN: 1469-185X\", \"ISSN: 1469-185X\", \"ISSN: 1464-7931\", \"PMID: 26468059\", \"DOI: 10.1111/brv.12230\"]}\n",

Of studies examining competition, results were highly variable with 53% reporting negative effects on wild bees, while 28% reported no effects and 19% reported mixed effects (varying with the bee species or variables examined). Equal numbers of studies examining plant communities reported positive (36%) and negative (36%) effects, with the remainder reporting no or mixed effects. Finally, the majority of studies on pathogen transmission (70%) reported potential negative effects of managed bees on wild bees. However, most studies across all topical areas documented the potential for impact (e.g. reporting the occurrence of competition or pathogens), but did not measure direct effects on wild bee fitness, abundance, or diversity. Furthermore, we found that results varied depending on whether managed bees were in their native or non-native range; managed bees within their native range had lesser competitive effects, but potentially greater effects on wild bees via pathogen transmission. We conclude that while this field has expanded considerably in recent decades, additional research measuring direct, long-term, and population-level effects of managed bees is needed to understand their potential impact on wild bees.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 29220412\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0189268\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

In this context, the assessment of landscape quality typically relies on spatial distribution studies, but, whether habitat-restoration techniques actually improve the health of targeted pollinator populations remains obscure. This gap could be filled by a comprehensive understanding of how gradients of landscape quality influence pollinator physiology. We therefore used this approach for honey bees (Apis mellifera) to test whether landscape patterns can shape bee health. We focused on the pre-wintering period since abnormally high winter colony losses have often been observed. By exposing colonies to different landscapes, enriched in melliferous catch crops and surrounded by semi-natural habitats, we found that bee physiology (i.e. fat body mass and level of vitellogenin) was significantly improved by the presence of flowering catch crops. Catch crop presence was associated with a significant increase in pollen diet diversity. The influence of semi-natural habitats on bee health was even stronger. Vitellogenin level was in turn significantly linked to higher overwintering survival. Therefore, our experimental study, combining landscape ecology and bee physiology, offers an exciting proof-of-concept for directly identifying stressful or suitable landscapes and promoting efficient pollinator conservation.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 28084452\", \"EISSN: 2045-2322\", \"DOI: 10.1038/srep40568\", \"ISSN: 2045-2322\"]}\n",

We measured the spectral properties of 581 natural surfaces, including rocks, sand, green leaves, and dry plant materials, sampled from tropical Cairns through to the southern tip of mainland Australia. We modelled in a hexagon colour space, how interactions between background spectra and flower-like colour stimuli affect reliable discrimination and detection in bee pollinators. We calculated the extent to which a given locus would be conflated with the loci of a different flower-colour stimulus using empirically determined colour discrimination regions for bee vision. Our results reveal that whilst colour signals are robust in homogeneous background viewing conditions, there could be significant pressure on plant flowers to evolve saliently-different colours to overcome background spectral noise.

Whether and how the number of available resources affects resource collection and subsequently consumers (e.g., through impacting functions associated with resources) have, however, been little investigated, although a better understanding of this relationship may help explain why the abundance and richness of many animal species typically decline with decreasing plant (resource) diversity. Using a social bee species as model (Tetragonula carbonaria), we investigated how plant species richness—recorded for study sites located in different habitats—and associated resource abundance affected the diversity and functionality (here defined as nutritional content and antimicrobial activity) of resources (i.e., pollen, nectar, and resin) collected by a generalist herbivorous consumer. The diversity of both pollen and resin collected strongly increased with increasing plant/tree species richness, while resource abundance was only positively correlated with resin diversity. These findings suggest that bees maximize resource diversity intake in (resource) diverse habitats. Collecting more diverse resources did, however, not increase their functionality, which appeared to be primarily driven by the surrounding (plant) source community in our study. In generalist herbivores, maximizing resource diversity intake may therefore primarily secure collection of sufficient amounts of resources across the entire foraging season, but it also ensures that the allocated resources meet all functional needs. Decreasing available resource diversity may thus impact consumers primarily by reduced resource abundance, but also by reduced resource functionality, particularly when resources of high functionality (e.g., from specific plant species) become scarce.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1002/ecs2.1758\", \"EISSN: 2150-8925\", \"ISSN: 2150-8925\"]}\n",

These small loops around the nest entrance are repeatedly interrupted by strikingly accurate back turns during which the ants stop and precisely gaze back to the nest entrance-presumably to learn the landmark panorama of the nest surroundings. However, as at this point the complete navigational toolkit is not yet available, the ants are in need of a reference system for the compass component of the path integrator to align their nest entrance-directed gazes. In order to find this directional reference system, we systematically manipulated the skylight information received by ants during learning walks in their natural habitat, as it has been previously suggested that the celestial compass, as part of the path integrator, might provide such a reference system. High-speed video analyses of distinct learning walk elements revealed that even exclusion from the skylight polarization pattern, UV-light spectrum and the position of the sun did not alter the accuracy of the look back to the nest behavior. We therefore conclude that\\nuses a different reference system to initially align their gaze directions. However, a comparison of neuroanatomical changes in the central complex and the mushroom bodies before and after learning walks revealed that exposure to UV light together with a naturally changing polarization pattern was essential to induce neuroplasticity in these high-order sensory integration centers of the ant brain.

Chromatic traits that allow reliable discrimination between rewarding and non-rewarding flowers have been proposed as an important feature of pollination syndromes: bee-pollinated flowers have spectral profiles that closely match the discrimination peaks of their pollinators across the visual spectrum. However, in the complexity of a natural environment, it may be hard for bees to even detect the presence of flowers. In particular, little is known about how discrimination and detection by bees may together contribute to pollinator-mediated selection on floral colour signals. We address here an unexplained feature of floral colour evolution: the extreme paucity of spectral patterns with pronounced changes in reflectance around 420–480 nm wavelength. We began by conducting experiments with honeybees in a Y-maze to determine their capacity to detect a stimulus rarely found in bee-pollinated flowers—one with a single sharp spectral reflectance change at 478 nm. We found bees to be poor at detecting this stimulus against a neutral background. We then conducted behaviourally-informed computer simulations that test how bee visual discrimination and detection interact, which yielded information about which flower colours most effectively facilitate cross-pollination. Finally, we identified from our previous work those bird-pollinated species whose floral colours had spectral characteristics similar to the stimulus used in the Y-maze experiment. These data demonstrate that plants can, and do, produce such spectra for pollinators other than bees. In combination, our results show that the interaction between colour discrimination and detection is important for understanding flower community assembly.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s10682-016-9843-6\", \"EISSN: 1573-8477\", \"ISSN: 0269-7653\"]}\n",

Animal-instigated pollination can be complex. Plants are usually visited by a number of different animal species, which in turn may visit flowers of several plant species. Therefore, the identification of the pollen carried by flower visitors is an essential first step in pollination biology. The skill and time required to identify pollen based on structure and morphology has been a major stumbling block in this field. Advances in the genetic analysis of DNA, using DNA barcoding, extracted directly from pollen offers an innovative alternative to traditional methods of pollen identification. This technique, which is reviewed in detail, can be used on pollen loads sampled from bees in the field and from specimens in historic collections. Here the importance of pollination, the role-players involved, their management and the evolution of their interactions, behaviour and morphology are reviewed – with a special focus on South African bees. Significance: • Pollen metabarcoding will enable the identification of pollen for a multitude of uses, including agriculture, conservation and forensics. • Plant–pollinator interaction documentation through pollen identification gives a more certain record of a visitor being a pollinator rather than a flower visitor that could be a nectar gatherer.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1996-7489\", \"DOI: 10.17159/sajs.2017/20160303\", \"ISSN: 0038-2353\", \"ISSN: 1996-7489\"]}\n",

In one of the two study locations, the fat body microbial composition was marked by the dominant presence of Arsenophonus sp. and Phyllobacterium sp. Bumblebees infected with Apicystis bombi, a eukaryotic parasite multiplying in the fat body, had a significant higher relative abundance of Arsenophonus sp. compared with the non‐infected individuals. In general, the infection of A. bombi correlated with a more interlinked microbial association network, as we observed an increase of significant associations between the relative abundance of bacteria present in the gut and fat body of infected bumblebees.

Additionally, we investigated whether the variation in gut microbial communities under each habitat affected the prevalence of two important bumblebee pathogens that have recently been associated with Bombus declines (Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi). Microbial community composition differed strongly among habitat types, both for fungi and bacteria. Fungi were almost exclusively associated with bumblebee queens from the forest habitats, and were not commonly detected in bumblebee queens from the urban sites. Further, gut bacterial communities of urban B. terrestris specimens were strongly dominated by bee-specific core bacteria like Snodgrassella (Betaproteobacteria) and Gilliamella (Gammaproteobacteria), whereas specimens from the forest sites contained a huge fraction of environmental bacteria. Pathogen infection was very low in urban populations and infection by Nosema was only observed in specimens collected from forest habitats. No significant relationship was found between pathogen prevalence and microbial gut diversity. However, there was a significant and negative relationship between prevalence of Nosema and relative abundance of the core resident Snodgrassella, supporting its role in pathogen defense. Overall, our results indicate that land-use change may lead to different microbial gut communities in bumblebees, which may have implications for bumblebee health, survival and overall fitness.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0204612\", \"PMID: 30359366\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

Here, we established systemic IAPV infections in reared bumblebee Bombus terrestris workers through feeding and injection and investigated the mortality, tissue tropism and viral localization. Injection of approximately 500 IAPV (IAPVinj stock) particles resulted in acute infection, viral loads within tissues that were relatively stable from bee to bee, and a distinctive tissue tropism, making this method suitable for studying systemic IAPV infection in bumblebees. Feeding with approximately 1 × 106 particles of the same virus stock did not result in systemic infection. A high-concentration stock of IAPV (IAPVfed stock) allowed us to feed bumblebees with approximately 1 × 109 viral particles, which induced both chronic and acute infection. We also observed a higher variability in viral titers within tissues and less clear tissue tropism during systemic infection, making feeding with IAPVfed stock less optimal for studying IAPV systemic infection. Strikingly, both infection methods and stocks with different viral loads gave a similar viral localization pattern in the brain and midgut of bumblebees with an acute infection.

Different resource requirements and the impact of tongue length on resource use are often overlooked aspects of these studies. Here, we examine floral resource use and niche overlap between introduced social bees and native solitary bees over two flowering seasons on The Remarkables mountain range, South Island, New Zealand. The native bee fauna of New Zealand is composed of short‐tongued solitary bees in the families Colletidae and Halictidae. Long‐tongued social bees were introduced 150 years ago, and Apis mellifera and Bombus species are now widespread. We analysed floral resource utilization by introduced bees (mainly Bombus terrestris) and native bees in relation to resource abundance across elevations in montane to alpine grassland communities. We modelled resource utilization and overlap between bee taxa using a novel index of floral resource availability, developed to more accurately describe floral density. Additionally, we sought to quantify the impact of honey bees by introducing hives, however, low densities in study plots prevented direct conclusions from being drawn. Native and introduced bees did, however, have distinctly different floral preferences over the flowering season with more niche overlap within, rather than between, native and introduced groups. Introduced bees showed a preference for introduced species in the family Fabaceae which native bees could not access. Native bees heavily utilized introduced Asteraceae as well as native floral resources that introduced bees did not prefer. The limited resource overlap between bee taxa indicated that bee communities in New Zealand may have reduced potential for competition, owing to the different resource requirements of solitary versus social bees and their differing abilities to access floral resources. These findings provide some potential explanations for contradictory evidence worldwide regarding the perceived detrimental impacts of introduced social bees.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1111/aec.12643\", \"ISSN: 1442-9985\", \"EISSN: 1442-9993\"]}\n",

Recently, a cytokine-like molecule vago, a member of the Single von Willebrand factor C-domain (SVC) protein family, has been shown to be induced by virus infection in a Dicer-2 dependent manner. SVCs are also reported to be responsive in relation to multiple environmental challenges including bacterial infections and the nutritional status in the model species Drosophila melanogaster. Within the bumblebee Bombus terrestris only one SVC member has been identified and is proven to be involved in both the host antiviral defense and the basal expression of AMP genes, thereby it is a possible candidate linking virus infection and AMPs induction. Here we showed that the injection of Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) resulted in a higher hymenoptaecin expression at 1dpi. This expression is IAPV specific as neither injection of slow bee paralysis virus (SBPV) nor random dsRNA results in a similar induction at 1dpi. We could not prove that hymenoptaecin expression after IAPV treatment was related to BtSVC, as a silencing experiment did not lower hymenoptaecin induction.

Previous studies on corpse removal have focused on perennial species that produce thousands of workers, a life history that may incur a greater need for hygienic behaviours. However, whether and how corpse removal occurs in annual species of social insect, which may experience different selection pressures for this behaviour, remains largely unknown. Here the corpse removal behaviour of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris was investigated by artificially adding larval and adult corpses into colonies. Larvae were removed more rapidly than adults, with adult corpses eliciting significantly more antennating and biting behaviours. Workers that removed larval corpses were significantly more specialized than the worker population at large, but this was not the case for workers that removed adult corpses. Workers that were previously observed spending more time inactive were slightly, but significantly less likely to perform corpse removal. Size did not affect whether a worker removed corpses, but workers that removed larvae were significantly larger than those that removed adult corpses. Finally, infecting larvae with the virulent parasite Nosema bombi did not elicit prophylactic removal. Our results provide the first quantification of corpse removal in an annual social insect and set the scene for comparative analyses of this important behaviour across social insect life histories.\\n•Corpse removal behaviour occurs in the annual social insect Bombus terrestris.•Behaviours performed by workers vary between adult and larval corpses.•Bees that remove larval corpses are more specialized workers.•Workers that remove larval corpses are larger than those that remove adult corpses.•Larvae inoculated with the virulent parasite Nosema bombi are not removed.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1095-8282\", \"ISSN: 0003-3472\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.anbehav.2018.02.003\"]}\n",

Pesticides have been proposed as a potential cause of this decline. Bees are exposed simultaneously to a variety of agrochemicals, which may cause synergistically detrimental impacts, which are incompletely understood. We investigated the toxicity of the fungicide imazalil in mixture with four common insecticides: fipronil (phenylpyrazoid), cypermethrin (pyrethroid), thiamethoxam, and imidacloprid (neonicotinoids). Ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor (EBI) fungicides like imazalil can inhibit P450 detoxification systems in insects and therefore fungicide − insecticide co‐occurrence might produce synergistic toxicity in bees. We assessed the impact of dietary fungicide − insecticide mixtures on the mortality and feeding rates of laboratory bumble bees (Bombus terrestris L.).\\nRESULTS\\nRegarding mortality, imazalil synergised the toxicity of fipronil, cypermethrin and thiamethoxam, but not imidacloprid. We found no synergistic effects on feeding rates.\\nCONCLUSION\\nOur findings suggest that P450‐based detoxification processes are differentially important in mitigating the toxicity of certain insecticides, even those of the same chemical class.

We analyzed the chemical composition of the volatile organic compounds produced in three distinct varieties of honey (i.e., manuka, honeydew, and clover honey). The composition of the chemical profile of the three honey varieties differed in the quality and in the ratio of compounds in the headspace. o-Methoxyacetophenone was the main compound in the headspace of all three honey varieties. Among the 40 compounds identified in the headspace in the three varieties, only seven shared compounds (i.e., benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, phenylacetaldehyde, 2-phenylethanol, isophorone, 4-oxoisophorone, and o-methoxyacetophenone) were present in the headspace of the three honey varieties. The relative attractiveness of various blends of the seven common compounds found in the three honey varieties was tested for the attraction to bumble bees in a mountain beech forest. A binary blend of isophorone and 4-oxoisophorone at a ratio of 90:10 was the most attractive blend for both bumble bee workers and queens.

Our land-use cluster analysis identified three site categories, and this categorization was a strong predictor of colony performance.

The relationship between decision speed and accuracy was influenced by predator detectability and the risk associated with making incorrect choices during the colour discrimination task. Predator crypsis resulted in a breakdown in the relationship between speed and accuracy, especially when making an incorrect floral choice incurred a distasteful quinine punishment. No single speed-accuracy tactic was found to be optimal in terms of foraging efficiency under either predation threat situation. However, bees that made faster decisions achieved higher nectar collection rates in predator free situations, while accurate bees achieved higher foraging rates under predation threat.

In this context, a parasitic infection can be viewed as an invasion into the preexisting microbial ecological community. Hence, in addition to the intrinsic defense mechanisms of the host itself, infection success depends on the colonization resistance of the microbiota. In the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, the microbiota provides resistance to the intestinal parasite Crithidia bombi, yet which properties actually provide protection remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the community structure of the gut microbiota—in terms of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences—before parasite exposure can be informative of the eventual infection outcome. Specifically, higher microbiota OTU diversity is associated with less resistance. However, the microbial community structure does not differ between infected and noninfected individuals or between infected individuals of varying susceptibility. This suggests that parasite infection success depends on the microbiota composition but that subsequent changes occur, although the exact alteration that occurs remains elusive. In fact, the bumblebee microbiota is surprisingly unaffected by parasite exposure and infection. Rather, the microbiota-host interaction before parasite exposure seems to be a key mechanism regulating resistance to infection.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0003-0147\", \"EISSN: 1537-5323\", \"DOI: 10.1086/698013\", \"PMID: 30016168\"]}\n",

We found that when an isoform is expressed in a given caste in the larval stage, it tends to be expressed in all castes at the larval stage. The same is true at the pupal stage. However, we see more complicated interactions between the adult castes with reproductive females showing different isoform expression compared to nonreproductive females and male adults showing the most distinct patterns. We found 455 isoform switching genes, that is genes, where one developmental stage, sex or caste uses a specific isoform and another type uses a different isoform.

Farmland bees can be widely exposed to dietary residues of neurotoxic neonicotinoid insecticides that appear in the nectar and pollen of treated bee-attractive crops, which may harm them. An earlier study shows that dietary neonicotinoids cause complex alterations to thermoregulation in honey bees, but their effect on the thermogenic capabilities of individual bumble bees has been untested previously. We therefore conducted laboratory trials involving separate dietary exposures of bumble bees to two neonicotinoids, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, and we measured their effects on the thoracic temperatures of bees during recovery from chilling. Specifically, we used thermal imaging to measure the rates of rewarming by individual bees after chill-induced torpor and to quantify their equilibrated thoracic temperatures post-recovery. We found that both toxicants caused dose-dependent decreases in the rates of rewarming and in the equilibrated thoracic temperatures. As previously found in honey bees, the dose–response relationship for imidacloprid exhibited a biphasic hormesis with low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition, for which we propose a mechanism. Our present study is among the first to detect ecologically relevant effects on bees in neonicotinoid exposures involving dietary concentrations below 5 ppb. If the effects on thoracic temperatures that we observed over a short period were sustained, they could have ecologically significant impacts on farmland bumble bees.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 29133226\", \"ISSN: 0022-1910\", \"ISSN: 1879-1611\", \"EISSN: 1879-1611\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.11.006\"]}\n",

World-wide declines in pollinators, including bumblebees, are attributed to a multitude of Stressors such as habitat loss, resource availability, emerging viruses and parasites, exposure to pesticides, and climate change, operating at various spatial and temporal scales. Disentangling individual and interacting effects of these Stressors, and understanding their impact at the individual, colony and population level are a challenge for systems ecology. Empirical testing of all combinations and contexts is not feasible. A mechanistic multilevel systems model (individual-colony-population-community) is required to explore resilience mechanisms of populations and communities under stress. 2. We present a model which can simulate the growth, behaviour and survival of six UK bumblebee species living in any mapped landscape. Bumble-BEEHAVE simulates, in an agent-based approach, the colony development of bumblebees in a realistic landscape to study how multiple Stressors affect bee numbers and population dynamics. We provide extensive documentation, including sensitivity analysis and validation, based on data from literature. The model is freely available, has flexible settings and includes a user manual to ensure it can be used by researchers, farmers, policy-makers, NGOs or other interested parties. 3. Model outcomes compare well with empirical data for individual foraging behaviour, colony growth and reproduction, and estimated nest densities. 4. Simulating the impact of reproductive depression caused by pesticide exposure shows that the complex feedback mechanisms captured in this model predict higher colony resilience to stress than suggested by a previous, simpler model. 5. Synthesis and applications. The Bumble-BEEHAVE model represents a significant step towards predicting bumblebee population dynamics in a spatially explicit way. It enables researchers to understand the individual and interacting effects of the multiple Stressors affecting bumblebee survival and the feedback mechanisms that may buffer a colony against environmental stress, or indeed lead to spiralling colony collapse. The model can be used to aid the design of field experiments, for risk assessments, to inform conservation and farming decisions and for assigning bespoke management recommendations at a landscape scale.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0021-8901\", \"ISSN: 1365-2664\", \"PMID: 30449898\", \"DOI: 10.1111/1365-2664.13165\", \"EISSN: 1365-2664\"]}\n",

Bumblebees were able to discriminate between poorly and highly rewarding flowers by using the presence of a nonsocial cue (a wooden rectangular white block).

We found that the IRI values were strictly correlated with the time elapsed between the gyne point and the switch point (i.e., from the moment of deposition of the first diploid egg that produces a gyne to the first haploid egg). We separated the colonies into two groups based on the mean value of the IRI: colonies with low IRI produced more gynes (93.8 ± 9.4), for a longer period (32.1 ± 1.8 days) and with a lower percentage of overlapped gynes (69 ± 5%) than colonies with high IRI (57.1 ± 21 gynes, 23.3 ± 2.9 days, and 100% overlapped gynes, respectively).

However, the floral traits that influence pollinator visitation are not usually the focus of breeding programmes, and therefore, it is likely that yield improvements may be made by optimizing floral traits to enhance pollinator visitation rates. We investigated the variation present in the floral reward of the bee‐pollinated crop Vicia faba (field bean). We examined the genetic potential for breeding flowers with a greater reward into current commercial varieties and used bee behavioral experiments to gain insight into the optimal nectar concentration to maximize bee preference. There was a large range of variation in the amount of pollen and nectar reward of flowers in the genotypes investigated. Bee behavioral experiments using nectar sugar concentrations found in V. faba lines suggest that Bombus terrestris prefers 55% w/w sugar solution over 40% w/w, but has no preference between 55% w/w and 68% w/w sugar solution. We provide a first indication of the force required to open V. faba flowers. Our results provide a valuable starting point toward breeding for varieties with optimized floral reward. Field studies are now needed to verify whether the genetic potential for breeding more rewarding flowers can translate into higher yield and yield stability.\\nThis study examines heritable variation in, and pollinator response to, key flower reward traits of an important legume crop.

The insect gustatory system encodes tastant identity and concentration through the independent firing of gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) that spike rapidly at stimulus onset and quickly adapt. Here, we show the first evidence that concentrated sugar evokes a temporally structured burst pattern of spiking involving two GRNs within the gustatory sensilla of bumblebees. Bursts of spikes resulted when a sucrose-activated GRN was inhibited by another GRN at a frequency of ∼22 Hz during the first 1 s of stimulation. Pharmacological blockade of gap junctions abolished bursting, indicating that bee GRNs have electrical synapses that produce a temporal pattern of spikes when one GRN is activated by a sugar ligand. Bursting permitted bee GRNs to maintain a high rate of spiking and to exhibit the slowest rate of adaptation of any insect species. Feeding bout duration correlated with coherent bursting; only sugar concentrations that produced bursting evoked the bumblebee’s feeding reflex. Volume of solution imbibed was a direct function of time in contact with food.

We quantified the effects of low-dose (1 ppb) imidacloprid exposure on the foraging behaviour of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Individual bumblebees were released into a flight arena containing three patches of robotic flowers whose colour (yellow, orange, blue) indicated whether the flower delivered a reward (sugar solution). Exposure to imidacloprid had no significant effect on measures of bumblebee physical performance (such as flight speed) or learning (identifying rewarding flowers). However, pesticide-treated bumblebees had reduced foraging motivation compared with the control bumblebees, as they visited fewer robotic flowers, were slower to start foraging and did not visit all three flower colours as often. Neonicotinoid concentrations of 1 ppb, often reported in plant nectar near agricultural lands, can thus affect the foraging behaviour of bumblebees. Even without a notable impact on flight performance and learning, a reduction in foraging motivation could explain the poor performance of colonies of bumblebees exposed to neonicotinoids.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2018.0506\", \"ISSN: 1471-2954\", \"ISSN: 0962-8452\", \"EISSN: 1471-2954\", \"PMID: 30051863\"]}\n",

In this study, we identify a highly conserved expression pattern in an insect‐only gene family, the Osiris genes, that is essential for development, but also plays a significant role in phenotypic plasticity and in immunity/toxicity responses. The majority of Osiris genes exist in a highly syntenic cluster, and the cluster itself appears to have arisen very early in the evolution of insects. We used developmental gene expression in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, the bumble bee, Bombus terrestris, the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, and the wood ant, Formica exsecta, to compare patterns of Osiris gene expression both during development and between alternate caste phenotypes in the polymorphic social insects. Developmental gene expression of Osiris genes is highly conserved across species and correlated with gene location and evolutionary history. The social insect castes are highly divergent in pupal Osiris gene expression. Sets of co‐expressed genes that include Osiris genes are enriched in gene ontology terms related to chitin/cuticle and peptidase activity. Osiris genes are essential for cuticle formation in both embryos and pupae, and genes co‐expressed with Osiris genes affect wing development. Additionally, Osiris genes and those co‐expressed seem to play a conserved role in insect toxicology defences and digestion. Given their role in development, plasticity, and protection, we propose that the Osiris genes play a central role in insect adaptive evolution.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 29322640\", \"ISSN: 1010-061X\", \"EISSN: 1420-9101\", \"ISSN: 1420-9101\", \"DOI: 10.1111/jeb.13238\"]}\n",

Semi-natural habitats and mass-flowering crops such as oilseed rape provide abundant floristic resources for bees. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influences of the spatial distribution of semi-natural habitats and oilseed rape fields on the abundance and the mean body size of a solitary bee in grasslands. We focused on a generalist mining bee, Andrena cineraria, that forages and reproduces during oilseed rape flowering. In 21 permanent grasslands of Eastern France, we captured 1 287 individuals (1 205 males and 82 females) and measured the body size of male individuals. The flower density in grasslands was quantified during bee captures (2016) and the landscape surrounding grasslands was characterized during two consecutive years (2015 and 2016). The influence of oilseed rape was tested through its distribution in the landscape during both the current year of bee sampling and the previous year. Bee abundance was positively influenced by the flower density in grasslands and by the area covered by oilseed rape around grasslands in the previous year. The mean body size of A. cineraria was explained by the interaction between flower density in the grassland and the distance to the nearest oilseed rape field in the current year: the flower density positively influenced the mean body size only in grasslands distant from oilseed rape. A. cineraria abundance and body size distribution were not affected by the area of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. The spatial distribution of oilseed rape fields (during both the current and the previous year) as well as the local density of grassland flowers drive both bee abundance and the mean value of an intraspecific trait (body size) in permanent grasslands. Space-time variations of bee abundance and mean body size in grasslands may have important ecological implications on plant pollination and on interspecific interactions between pollinators. Specifically, a competition between bee species for nesting sites might occur in oilseed rape rich landscapes, thus raising important conservation issues for bee species that do not benefit from oilseed rape resources.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 29787595\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197684\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

However, crop pollination services might be compromised when wild pollinators are scarce. Managed pollinators are commonly used in crops to supplement such services with the assumption that they will enhance crop yield. However, information on the spatiotemporal pollinator-dependence of crops is still limited. We assessed the contribution of commercial bumble bee colonies compared to the available pollinator community on strawberry (‘Fortuna’ variety) flower visitation and strawberry quality across a landscape gradient of agricultural intensification (i.e. polytunnel berry crop cover). We used colonies of bumble bees in winter and in spring, i.e. when few and most wild pollinators are in their flight period, respectively. The placement of colonies increased visits of bumble bees to strawberry flowers, especially in winter. The use of bumble bee colonies did not affect flower visitation by other insects, mainly honey bees, hoverflies and other Diptera. Flower visitation by both honey bees and wild insects did not vary between seasons and was unrelated to the landscape gradient of berry crop cover. Strawberries were of the highest quality (i.e. weight) when insect-mediated pollination was allowed, and their quality was positively related to wild flower visitors in winter but not in spring. However, increased visits to strawberry flowers by managed bumble bees and honey bees had no effect on strawberry weight. Our results suggest that the pollination services producing high quality strawberry fruits are provided by the flower visitor community present in the study region without the need to use managed bumble bees.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1439-1791\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.baae.2018.05.008\"]}\n",

To balance the costs and benefits of copying others, animals have to discern situations in which it is more advantageous to use social rather than personal information. Here, we used foraging bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) in a controlled laboratory setting and showed that the difficulty of a foraging task affects how the bees weight the 2 types of information. We used artificial flowers to devise easy and difficult discriminatory tasks, and tested the influence of floral and social cues on decision making. When facing an easy discrimination task, foraging bees were likely to rely on personal information and were only marginally affected by social information. By contrast, they prioritized social over personal information when flower discrimination was difficult and therefore the probability of making errors was higher.

Mutations at these loci represent a significant source of genetic variation and can facilitate rapid adaptation. Bumblebees are important pollinating insects occupying a wide range of habitats. However, to date, molecular mechanisms underlying the potential adaptation of bumblebees to diverse habitats are largely unknown. In the present study, we investigate how TRs contribute to genetic variation in bumblebees, thus potentially facilitating adaptation. We identified 26,595 TRs from the assembled 18 chromosome sequences of the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), 66.7% of which reside in genic regions. We also compared TRs found in B. terrestris with those present in the assembled genome sequence of a congener, B. impatiens. We found that a total of 1,137 TRs were variable in length between the two sequenced bumblebee species, and further analysis reveals that 101 of them are located within coding regions. These 101 TRs are responsible for coding sequence variation and correspond to protein sequence length variation between the two bumblebee species. The variability of identified TRs in coding regions between bumblebees was confirmed by PCR amplification of a subset of loci. Functional classification of bumblebee genes where coding sequences include variable-length TRs suggests that a majority of genes (87%) that could be assigned to a protein class are related to transcriptional regulation. Our results show that TRs contribute to coding sequence variation in bumblebees, and thus may facilitate the adaptation of bumblebees through diversifying proteins involved in controlling gene expression.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1759-6653\", \"DOI: 10.1093/gbe/evy244\", \"PMID: 30398620\", \"ISSN: 1759-6653\"]}\n",

In recent years a dramatic decline of pollinators has been reported in many countries. The drivers of this declines appear to be associated with pathogen infections like viruses, bacteria or fungi in combination with pesticide exposure. The aim of this study was thus to investigate the impact of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, on the cellular immune response of two pollinators (Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris) during simultaneous immune activation with LPS (lipopolysaccharide) of Escherichia coli. For this purpose the phagocytosis capacity as well as the production of H2O2 and NO of larval hemocytes, exposed to five different imidacloprid concentrations in vitro, was measured. All used pesticide concentrations showed a weakening effect on phagocytosis with but also without LPS activation. Imidacloprid decreased H2O2 and increased NO production in honeybees. Immune activation by LPS clearly reinforced the effect of imidacloprid on the immune response of hemocytes in all three immune parameters tested.

However, little is known about the potential behavioural mechanisms behind the neonicotinoid-associated pollinator decline. We quantified the effects of low-dose (1 ppb) imidacloprid exposure on the foraging behaviour of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Individual bumblebees were released into a flight arena containing three patches of robotic flowers whose colour (yellow, orange, blue) indicated whether the flower delivered a reward (sugar solution). Exposure to imidacloprid had no significant effect on measures of bumblebee physical performance (such as flight speed) or learning (identifying rewarding flowers). However, pesticide-treated bumblebees had reduced foraging motivation compared with the control bumblebees, as they visited fewer robotic flowers, were slower to start foraging and did not visit all three flower colours as often. Neonicotinoid concentrations of 1 ppb, often reported in plant nectar near agricultural lands, can thus affect the foraging behaviour of bumblebees. Even without a notable impact on flight performance and learning, a reduction in foraging motivation could explain the poor performance of colonies of bumblebees exposed to neonicotinoids.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0962-8452\", \"EISSN: 1471-2954\"]}\n",

The grain legume faba bean (Vicia faba L.) is partially allogamous and benefits from bee pollination because bees transfer cross-pollen and improve seed set. Here, we study mechanisms behind bee pollination and address the question whether individual bee species differ in their efficiency to pollinate V. faba. We studied the foraging behaviour of bee pollinators in faba bean fields using transect walks, and the species-specific flower constancy based on pollen analyses. For the first time, we examined the species-specific effects of bee pollinators on seed set and degree of cross-fertilisation. We found that the two locally dominant pollinator species, Apis mellifera (56% of all observed individuals) and Bombus terrestris agg. (37%), did not provide efficient pollination service since they mostly robbed nectar. The less frequent species Bombus hortorum (4%), however, revealed to be the most efficient pollinator. It exhibited only legitimate flower visits, high flower constancy and additionally increased seed set and the degree of cross-fertilisation more than any other species. Our study demonstrates especially that less frequent and more specialised pollinator species with long tongues improve pollination and cross-fertilisation of faba bean, which is of great importance in plant breeding and seed production.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1873-2305\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.agee.2018.05.003\", \"ISSN: 0167-8809\"]}\n",

All colour properties were weakly related to phylogeny. We found a shift from overdispersed floral colours and high chromatic contrast with the background (for bees) in the low altitude, to clustered floral colours (UV and green range for bees and flies) and clustered chromatic and achromatic properties in the high altitude. Different from flies, bees could discriminate floral colours in all altitudinal ranges. Low altitudes are likely to exhibit suitable conditions for more plant species, increasing competition for pollinators and floral colour divergence. Conversely, the increase in UV irradiance in high altitudes may filter plants with specific floral UV-reflectance patterns.

In this context, a parasitic infection can be viewed as an invasion into the preexisting microbial ecological community. Hence, in addition to the intrinsic defense mechanisms of the host itself, infection success depends on the colonization resistance of the microbiota. In the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, the microbiota provides resistance to the intestinal parasite Crithidia bombi, yet which properties actually provide protection remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the community structure of the gut microbiota-in terms of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences-before parasite exposure can be informative of the eventual infection outcome. Specifically, higher microbiota OTU diversity is associated with less resistance. However, the microbial community structure does not differ between infected and noninfected individuals or between infected individuals of varying susceptibility. This suggests that parasite infection success depends on the microbiota composition but that subsequent changes occur, although the exact alteration that occurs remains elusive. In fact, the bumblebee microbiota is surprisingly unaffected by parasite exposure and infection. Rather, the microbiota-host interaction before parasite exposure seems to be a key mechanism regulating resistance to infection.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0003-0147\", \"EISSN: 1537-5323\"]}\n",

We reared colonies from wild-caught bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) queens, placed them at sites characterized by varying degrees of urbanization from inner city to rural farmland and monitored the production of sexual offspring across the entire colony cycle. Our land-use cluster analysis identified three site categories, and this categorization was a strong predictor of colony performance. Crucially, colonies in the two clusters characterized by urban development produced more sexual offspring than those in the cluster dominated by agricultural land. These colonies also reached higher peak size, had more food stores, encountered fewer parasite invasions and survived for longer. Our results show a link between urbanization and bumblebee colony reproductive success, supporting the theory that urban areas provide a refuge for pollinator populations in an otherwise barren agricultural landscape.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0962-8452\", \"EISSN: 1471-2954\"]}\n",

We parameterized and validated the model based on empirical observations of commercial raspberry in western Argentina. To assess the effects of pollination intensity for fruit production, we conducted simulations over a range of visit number per flower by the two primary managed pollinators worldwide, Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris. Simulations identified that ~15–35 visits per flower by A. mellifera or ~10–20 visits by B. terrestris provide adequate pollination and maximize raspberry fruit quality (i.e., estimated as the proportion of ovules that develop into drupelets). Visits in excess of these optima reduce simulated fruit quality, and flowers receiving >670 honey bee visits or >470 bumble bee visits would produce fruits of poorer quality than those receiving no bee visits. The simulations generated consistent, unbiased predictions of fruit quality for 12 raspberry fields.

The pathogen was shown to colonize stigmata, move along the stylar furrow, and penetrate the receptacles via the style or nectarhodes.

This has been a major problem worldwide since a pandemic outbreak in 2008. The results show that flower tissues, especially the stigmata which receive transmitted pollen, are crucial sites allowing Psa to grow and penetrate into the plants. Evidence is presented of bacterial transmission via the pollen dispersed from plants that do not themselves show signs of infection.

We tested colour-naive bees and foragers from colonies that had been enclosed in large flight cages for a long time. Bees were shortly trained with triplets of neutral, UV-grey stimuli placed randomly at eight locations on a black training disk to induce foraging motivation.

Nest initiation and survival are thus key drivers of both bumblebee pollination services and population dynamics. We performed the first laboratory experiment with the model bumblebee species Bombus impatiens that explores how early nesting success is impacted by the effects of temporary or more sustained exposure to sublethal levels of a neonicotinoid-type insecticide (imidacloprid at 5 ppb in nectar) and by reliance on a monofloral pollen diet, two factors that have been previously implicated in bumblebee decline. We found that queens exhibited increased mortality and dramatically reduced activity levels when exposed to imidacloprid, as well as delayed nest initiation and lower brood numbers in the nest, but partially recovered from these effects when they only received early, temporary exposure. The effects of pollen diet on individual queen- and colony-level responses were overshadowed by effects of the insecticide, although a monofloral pollen diet alone was sufficient to negatively impact brood production. These findings speak to the sensitivity of queen bumblebees during the nest initiation phase of the colony cycle, with implications for how queens and their young nests are uniquely impacted by exposure to threats such as pesticide exposure and foraging habitat unsuitability.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 29899072\", \"ISSN: 1471-2954\", \"ISSN: 0962-8452\", \"DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2018.0761\", \"EISSN: 1471-2954\"]}\n",

In the present study, we examined the relative contributions of different habitat types to the landscape-scale species richness of vascular plants within farmland of varying landscape complexity. We also analysed pollen collected by bees to examine the extent to which the different habitat types contributed towards the provisioning of floral resources for three taxa (Bombus terrrestris, Megachile sp. and Osmia bicornis). We found that plant species richness increased with landscape complexity (defined as the proportion of semi-natural habitats). The relative contribution of small fragments of non-arable habitat to total plant species richness was high within all landscape types, especially in relation to the small area they covered. The importance of small non-arable fragments for the provisioning of floral resources to bees varied over time and between taxa. Bombus terrestris used the different habitat types differently during different parts of the growing season: arable fields were important early in the season, leys late in the season, and small non-arable habitat fragments during the mid-season when no mass-flowering crops were in bloom. In contrast, Megachile sp. and O. bicornis mainly foraged on plants occurring within grasslands. We conclude that small fragments of non-arable habitat are important for plant species richness at the landscape-scale and that their importance for plants may cascade to the bees that use them as foraging resources.

For Mendacibombus bumblebees, high‐elevation specialists with distributions centred on the QTP, we examine broader explanations. We extend integrative biogeography to cover multiple contributing factors by using a framework of sequential filters: 1) molecular evidence from four genes is used to estimate phylogenetic relationships, with time calibration from a published estimate; 2) spatial evidence from current distributions is combined with the phylogeny and constrained by a model of short‐distance dispersal along mountain corridors to estimate ancestral distributions by both S‐DIVA and S‐DEC analysis; 3) geological evidence from the literature is used to constrain when high mountain ranges were uplifted to become potential corridors; and 4) climatological evidence from Mendacibombus niche‐evolution reconstructions and from palaeoclimate simulations is used to constrain when habitat was suitable in key gaps within corridors. Explanations for Mendacibombus distributions can be identified that require only short‐distance dispersal along mountain corridors, commensurate with the limited dispersal ability observed for bumblebees. These explanations depend on the timing of uplift of mountain ranges, regional climate change, and climate‐niche evolution. The uplift of the QTP may have contributed to the initial Oligocene divergence of the common ancestor of Mendacibombus from other bumblebees, but for the first two thirds of the history of Mendacibombus, only a single lineage has present‐day descendants. Divergence of multiple extant Mendacibombus lineages coincided with the Late Miocene–Pliocene uplift of externally connecting mountains, combined with regional climate cooling. These changes provided greater connectivity of suitable habitat, allowing these bumblebees to disperse out of the western QTP via new high bridges, escaping along the mountain corridors of the Tian Shan and Hindu Kush ranges, reaching eventually far to the west (Iberian Peninsula) and to the north‐east (Kamchatka).\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1600-0587\", \"ISSN: 1600-0587\", \"DOI: 10.1111/ecog.03074\", \"ISSN: 0906-7590\"]}\n",

Overall, 75% of nests produced gynes, with marked differences between species; the recently arrived species, Bombus hypnorum, had the highest proportion of colonies surviving to gyne production (96%), with the long‐tongued Bombus hortorum having the lowest success in reaching gyne production (41%). There were also large differences between bumblebee species in the timing of nesting, gyne production and nest mortality, with B. hypnorum and Bombus pratorum nests starting early, producing most gynes before mid‐summer, and then dying off in June, whereas at the other end of the spectrum Bombus pascuorum nests started late and produced gynes mainly in August. There was evidence for the partial or complete destruction of 100 nests. The main reported causes were excavation by a large mammal, probably primarily Meles meles (50%). Human disturbance was the second greatest cause of nest mortality (26%), followed by flooding (7%). Wax moth infestations were common (55% of nests), with B. hypnorum nests most frequently infested. However, infestation did not results in reduced likelihood of gyne production, perhaps because infestations often do not become severe until after some gynes have been produced.

Thus the term ‘forager’ encompasses multiple distinct behaviors that rely on different sensory modalities. Despite a robust literature on bumblebee foraging behavior, few studies are directly relevant to sensory-guided search; i.e. how workers locate novel patches. The first step in answering this question is to determine what sensory information is available to searching bumblebees. This manuscript presents a computational model that elucidates the relative frequency of visual and olfactory cues that are available to workers searching for floral resources under a range of ecologically relevant scenarios. Model results indicate that odor is the most common sensory cue encountered during search flights. When the likelihood of odor-plume contact is higher, odor-encounter is ubiquitous. While integrative (visual + olfactory) cues are common when foragers are searching for larger flowers (e.g.\\nEchinacea\\n), they become rare when foragers are searching for small flowers (e.g.\\nPenstemon\\n). Visual cues are only encountered in isolation when foragers are seeking large flowers with a low odor-plume contact probability. These results indicate that despite the multisensory nature of floral signals, different modalities may be encountered in isolation during search-behavior, as opposed to the reliably multimodal signals encountered during patch-exploitation or nectar/ pollen acquisition.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 2045-2322\", \"PMID: 30275496\", \"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-32897-y\", \"ISSN: 2045-2322\"]}\n",

Here, we investigated the role of optic flow cues in the control of learning flights by manipulating spatial texture in the ventral and panoramic visual field. We measured height, lateral displacement relative to the nest and ground speed during learning flights in bumblebees when ventral and panoramic optic flow cues were present or minimised, or features of the ground texture varied in size. Our observations show that ventral optic flow cues were required for the smooth execution of learning flights. We also found that bumblebees adjusted their flight height in response to variations of the visual texture on the ground.

Bumblebees showed a pronounced positive local density response in mitigation sites and the surrounding landscape that was in line with significant landscape‐level increases in abundance. However, solitary bees showed no local response to mitigation sites, and the landscape‐level increases in abundance only became apparent when the area of bee habitat was taken into account.\\nIncorporating the area of both newly created and pre‐existing pollinator habitats into effect estimates accounts for density‐dependent processes such as dilution, spillover and local concentration of individuals.

Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) form annual colonies which must rapidly increase their worker populations to support rearing reproductive individuals before the end of the season. Therefore, colony growth and reproduction should be dependent on the quality and quantity of pollen resources in the surrounding landscape. Our previous research found that B. impatiens foraging preferences to different plant species were shaped by pollen protein:lipid nutritional ratios (P:L), with foragers preferring pollen species with a ~5:1 P:L ratio. In this study, we placed B. impatiens colonies in three different habitats (forest, forest edge, and valley) to determine whether pollen nutritional quality collected by the colonies differed between areas that may differ in resource abundance and diversity. We found that habitat did not influence the collected pollen nutritional quality, with colonies in all three habitats collecting pollen averaging a 4:1 P:L ratio. Furthermore, there was no difference in the nutritional quality of the pollen collected by colonies that successfully reared reproductives and those that did not. We found however, that “nutritional intake,” calculated as the colony‐level intake rate of nutrient quantities (protein, lipid, and sugar), was strongly related to colony growth and reproductive output. Therefore, we conclude that B. impatiens colony performance is a function of the abundance of nutritionally appropriate floral resources in the surrounding landscape. Because we did not comprehensively evaluate the nutrition provided by the plant communities in each habitat, it remains to be determined how B. impatiens polylectic foraging strategies helps them select among the available pollen nutritional landscape in a variety of plant communities to obtain a balance of key macronutrients.\\nBumble bee (Bombus impatiens) colonies in the field collected similar pollen protein, lipid, and carbohydrate macronutrient values across different habitats, including consistent protein:lipid ratios that they preferred in previous controlled experiments. Nutritional intake, a metric quantifying the rate of macronutrients collected by foragers on an hourly basis, was highly predictive of bumble bee colony growth and reproductive output.

In this study, we examine the effect of Quaternary climate instability on population genetic variability of a bumble bee pollinator species, Bombus huntii in western North America. Pleistocene and contemporary B. huntii habitat suitability (HS) was estimated with an environmental niche model (ENM) by associating 1,035 locality records with 10 bioclimatic variables. To estimate genetic variability, we genotyped 380 individuals from 33 localities at 13 microsatellite loci. Bayesian inference was used to examine population structure with and without a priori specification of geographic locality. We compared isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by resistance (IBR) models to examine population differentiation within and among the Bayesian inferred genetic clusters. Furthermore, we tested for the effect of environmental niche stability (ENS) on population genetic diversity with linear regression. As predicted, high‐latitude B. huntii habitats exhibit low ENS when compared to low‐latitude habitats. Two major genetic clusters of B. huntii inhabit western North America: (a) a north genetic cluster predominantly distributed north of 28°N and (b) a south genetic cluster distributed south of 28°N. In the south genetic cluser, both IBD and IBR models are significant. However, in the north genetic cluster, IBD is significant but not IBR. Furthermore, the IBR models suggest that low‐latitude montane populations are surrounded by habitat with low HS, possibly limiting dispersal, and ultimately gene flow between populations. Finally, we detected high genetic diversity across populations in regions that have been climatically unstable since the last glacial maximum (LGM), and low genetic diversity across populations in regions that have been climatically stable since the LGM. Understanding how species have responded to climate change has the potential to inform management and conservation decisions of both ecological and economic concerns.\\nBombus huntii foraging on Echinacea.

However, the repeated use of chemicals has caused insecticide resistance to be developed by pests. Therefore, there is a growing demand to develop biopesticides that have high insecticidal effects but little adverse impacts to crops and nontarget organisms. In this study, three natural compounds were investigated for insecticidal effects against three pests, B. tabaci, M. persicae, and F. occidentalis, and nontarget effects to a pollinator, Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in laboratory. The three natural compounds, named JP503, G.sol$^{(R)}$, and NO40, were an extract from Perilla frutescens var. crispa with phytoncide essential oil from pine tree, a commercialized disinfectant solution, and a type of nitric oxide in aqueous solution. Among these compounds, JP503 showed high and acute insecticidal effects on all of the three pests causing 100% mortality in 3 h. In addition, this compound resulted in the same level of acute lethality to the pollinator. Moreover, JP503 caused significant leaf damage when applied to sweet pepper plants in greenhouse conditions. The results indicate that the candidate compound would have limited potential for wide application to cash crop such as sweet peppers.

To gain greater insight into mechanisms and potential conservation implications of such ‘immune-brain crosstalk’ in bumblebees, we non-pathogenetically activated humoral and cellular immune pathways in individuals and then tested for long-term reductions in cognitive performance and foraging proficiency. We show that chronic activation of humoral, but not a cellular, immune pathways and effectors in foragers significantly reduces their ability to flexibly and efficiently harvest resources in multi-sensory floral environments for at least 7 days post-treatment. Humoral defense responses thus have the potential to confer significant foraging costs to bumblebee foragers over timeframes that would negatively impact colony growth and reproductive output under natural conditions.

In a laboratory study we characterized the function of different floral signal components transmitted by associated floral parts and the interaction of those signal components. Using Solanum houstonii flowers, we focused on two major floral parts, corolla and anthers, involved in signalling bumblebee, Bombus impatiens, visitors. We further examined how experience affected the relationship between signal component and floral part. Floral visits involve a stepwise process in which bees approach, land and acquire pollen. We found that the corolla plays the dominant role in eliciting approaches by bees, whether naïve or experienced. Landing is elicited by corolla signals and, to a lesser but additive degree, anther signals. Following experience, anther signals nearly completely dominate corolla signals in eliciting landing. The anthers convey signals mediating pollen acquisition, regardless of the bee's experience level.

Here, we test for pollination by mimicry in Diuris (Orchidaceae), a genus hypothesized to attract pollinators via mimicry of a range of co-occurring pea plants (Faboideae).\\nMethods\\nObservations of pollinator behaviour were made for Diuris brumalis using arrays of orchid flowers. An analysis of floral traits in the co-flowering community and spectral reflectance measurements were undertaken to test if Di. brumalis and the pea plants showed strong similarity and were likely to be perceived as the same by bees. Pollen removal and fruit-set were recorded at 18 sites over two years to test if fitness of Di. brumalis increased with the abundance of the model species.\\nKey Results\\nDiuris brumalis shares the pollinator species Trichococolletes capillosus and T. leucogenys (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) with co-flowering Faboideae from the genus Daviesia. On Di. brumalis, Trichocolletes exhibited the same stereotyped food-foraging and mate-patrolling behaviour that they exhibit on Daviesia. Diuris and pea plants showed strong morphological similarity compared to the co-flowering plant community, while the spectral reflectance of Diuris was similar to that of Daviesia spp. Fruit-set and pollen removal of Di. brumalis was highest at sites with a greater number of Daviesia flowers.\\nConclusions\\nDiuris brumalis is pollinated by mimicry of co-occurring congeneric Faboideae species. Evidence for mimicry of multiple models, all of which share pollinator species, suggests that this may represent a guild mimicry system. Interestingly, Di. brumalis belongs to a complex of species with similar floral traits, suggesting that this represents a useful system for investigating speciation in lineages that employ mimicry of food plants.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1095-8290\", \"PMID: 30184161\", \"ISSN: 0305-7364\", \"EISSN: 1095-8290\", \"DOI: 10.1093/aob/mcy166\"]}\n",

Only a subset of potential pollinators, mainly large bees, learn to successfully forage on such flowers. Thus, complexity may comprise a morphological filter that restricts the range of visitors and thereby increases food intake for successful foragers. Such pollinator specialization, in turn, promotes flower constancy and reduces cross-species pollen transfer, providing fitness benefits to plants with complex flowers. Since visual signals associated with floral morphological complexity are generally honest (i.e., indicate food rewards), pollinators need to perceive and process them. Physiological studies show that bees detect distant flowers through long-wavelength sensitive photoreceptors. Bees effectively perceive complex shapes and learn the positions of contours based on their spatial frequencies. Complex flowers require long handling times by naive visitors, and become highly profitable only for experienced foragers. To explore possible pathways towards the evolution of floral complexity, we discuss cognitive mechanisms that potentially allow insects to persist on complex flowers despite low initial foraging gains, suggest experiments to test these mechanisms, and speculate on their adaptive value.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1422-0067\", \"ISSN: 1661-6596\", \"DOI: 10.3390/ijms19061681\", \"PMID: 29882762\", \"ISSN: 1422-0067\"]}\n",

Additionally, we probed how subtle changes in the spectral characteristics of the traps affect the bee captures once a highly selective excitation of the blue photoreceptor is achieved. It was established that selective excitation of the green photoreceptor type was not attractive, in contrast to that of the blue photoreceptor type.

Though abundance and diversity of pollinators (particularly bees) have declined over the past several decades, a concomitant increase in reliance on pollinators presents a challenge to food production. Development of crop varieties with specific nectar or nectar-related traits to attract and retain pollinating insects is an appealing strategy to help address needs of agriculture and pollinators for several reasons. First, many crops have specific traits which have been identified to enhance crop-pollinator interactions. Also, an improved understanding of mechanisms that govern nectar-related traits suggest simplified phenotyping and breeding are possible. Finally, the use of nectar-related traits to enhance crop pollination should complement other measures promoting pollinators and will not limit options for crop production or require any changes by growers (other than planting varieties that are more attractive or rewarding to pollinators). In this article, we review the rationale for improving crop-pollinator interactions, the effects of specific plant traits on pollinator species, and use cultivated sunflowers as a case study. Recent research in sunflower has (i) associated variation in bee visitation with specific floral traits, (ii) quantified benefits of pollinators to hybrid yields, and (iii) used genetic resources in sunflower and other plants to find markers associated with key floral traits. Forthcoming work to increase pollinator rewards should enable sunflower to act as a model for using nectar-related traits to enhance crop-pollinator interactions.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1664-462X\", \"DOI: 10.3389/fpls.2018.00812\", \"EISSN: 1664-462X\", \"PMID: 29967631\"]}\n",

Indeed, the term 'ecological Armageddon' has been used in the media. However, to know whether or not a wholesale decline in flying pollinators (including non-bee species) is occurring across the world is very difficult, due to an insufficiency of geographically widespread and long-term data. Bees, as the best documented species, can be seen to be suffering from chronic exposure to a range of stressors, which include: a loss of abundance and diversity of flowers, and a decline in suitable habitat for them to build nests; long-term exposure to agrochemicals, including pesticides such as neonicotinoids; and infection by parasites and pathogens, many inadvertently spread by the actions of humans. It is likely that climate change may impact further on particular pollinators, for example bumble bees, which are cool-climate specialists. Moreover, the co-operative element of various different stress factors should be noted; thus, for example, exposure to pesticides is known to diminish detoxification mechanisms and also immune responses, hence lowering the resistance of bees to parasitic infections. It is further conspicuous that for those wild non-bee insects – principally moths and butterflies – where data are available, the picture is also one of significant population losses. Alarmingly, a recent study in Germany indicated that a decline in the biomass of flying insects had occurred by 76% in less than three decades, as sampled in nature reserves across the country. Accordingly, to fully answer the question posed in the title of this article 'pollinator decline - an ecological calamity in the making?' will require many more detailed, more geographically encompassing, more species-inclusive, and longer-term studies, but the available evidence points to a clear 'probably', and the precautionary principle would suggest this is not a prospect we can afford to ignore.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 2047-7163\", \"DOI: 10.3184/003685018X15202512854527\", \"ISSN: 0036-8504\", \"PMID: 29669627\", \"EISSN: 2047-7163\"]}\n",

Honey bees and bumble bees are eusocial central place foragers. Honey bees have large perennial colonies while bumble bee colonies are annual and considerably smaller. Foraging range, body size, and division of labor also vary between these two bee species. Honey bees use their unique dance language to recruit foragers to the most profitable patches. Bumble bees exploit patches individually and develop trapline foraging patterns. We expect such differences among bee species to engender differences in foraging activity. Moreover, variation in resource availability and in colony needs over the flowering season, can affect bee foraging activity. Finally, spatial variation in resource availability may impact bumble bees to a greater extent than honey bees due to their smaller foraging range. Using miniaturized radio frequency identification (RFID), we tracked the foraging activity of individual bees to and from hives at three sites and over five time periods. Pollen pellets were also collected from bees returning to the hive. We compared the European honey bee, Apis mellifera, and the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. Linear mixed effect models determined the impact of bee species, time of season (period) and site, and their interactions, on multiple foraging metrics calculated from the RFID data and on pollen dry weight. Relative to honey bees, individual bumble bees made more foraging trips each day, resulting in a greater time spent foraging. A greater proportion of RFID tagged bumble bees foraged each day and bumble bees brought heavier pollen sacs to the hive compared to honey bees. Foraging bout duration did not vary between bee species and none of the foraging metrics varied among time periods or among sites. Both bee species brought heavier pollen sacs back to the hive at the beginning and the end of the flowering season. These results are discussed in terms of species differences in foraging strategies, size of individuals and colonies, and temporal variation in colony needs and resource availability.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 2296-701X\", \"DOI: 10.3389/fevo.2018.00156\", \"EISSN: 2296-701X\"]}\n",

Populations that demonstrated strong memory formation (longer duration) under grouped conditions demonstrated weaker memory formation and reduced both speed and thigmotaxis following isolation. In wild populations, snails showed no relationship between memory and exploration in grouped conditions; however, following isolation, exploration behaviour was negatively correlated with memory, i.e. slow-explorers showing low levels of thigmotaxis formed stronger memories.

During normal reproduction in Hymenoptera, three of the four products of meiosis that are present in newly-laid eggs are lost as polar bodies, while the remaining pronucleus either develops as a haploid male or fuses with a sperm nucleus to produce a diploid zygote. In contrast, in thelytokous reproduction, which is uncommon but taxonomically widespread, two of the four products of meiosis fuse, as if one acted as a sperm. Queenless workers of Apis mellifera capensis, a subspecies of honey bee from South Africa, routinely reproduce thelytokously. Unmated A. m. capensis queens can also be induced to lay thelytokously by narcosis with carbon dioxide, but mated queens are never thelytokous. We artificially inseminated A. m. capensis queens using CO2 narcosis. Up to 1/3 of offspring workers carried two maternal alleles and an allele of one father whereas no three-allele progeny were seen in control queens of the arrhenotokous (unfertilized eggs result in males) subspecies A. m. scutellata. Flow cytometry of three-allele individuals revealed that they were triploid and arose from the fertilization of a thelytokous fusion nucleus. We then reared six queens from a narcotized A. m. capensis queen and determined the ploidy of the offspring queens based on microsatellites. One of the five daughters was triploid. Following artificial insemination, this queen produced unfertilized thelytokous diploid eggs at high frequency, and unfertilized triploid eggs at much lower frequency. If fertilized, thelytokous diploid eggs were non-viable, even though triploidy in itself does not impede normal development. In contrast, when the rarer triploid eggs were fertilized, a proportion developed into viable tetraploids.

One potential impact with largely unforeseen consequences is the potential admixture of introduced with autochthonous species through hybridization. Throughout the world, bumblebees have been deliberately introduced for crop pollination with known negative impacts on native pollinators. Given the likely allochthonous origin of commercial bumblebees used in Portugal (subspecies Bombus terrestris terrestris and B. t. dalmatinus), our aim was to assess their putative introgression with the native Iberian subspecies B. terrestris lusitanicus. We analysed one mitochondrial gene, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COX1) and genomic data involving thousands of genome‐wide restriction‐site‐associated DNA markers (RAD‐seq). In the mitochondrial COX1 analyses, we detected one relatively common haplotype in commercial bumblebees, also present in wild samples collected nearby the greenhouses where the commercial hives are used. In the RAD‐seq analysis, we found a clear genetic differentiation between native and commercial lineages. Furthermore, we detected candidate hybrids in the wild, as well as putatively escaped commercial bumblebees, some of which being potentially fertile males. Although we cannot assess directly the fitness effects of introgressed alleles, there is a risk of maladaptive allele introgression to the local bumblebee subspecies, which can negatively impact autochthon populations. One immediate recommendation to farmers is for the proper disposal of hive boxes, after their use in greenhouses, so as to minimize the risk of escapees contaminating native populations. On the other hand, the feasibility of using local subspecies B. t. lusitanicus, preferably with local production, should be evaluated.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1111/eva.12732\", \"EISSN: 1752-4571\", \"PMID: 30976302\", \"ISSN: 1752-4571\"]}\n",

While B. terrestris showed a strong fidelity to courgette flowers for nectar, courgette pollen was not found in any pollen loads from returning foragers.

Molecular studies have estimated that bumblebee colonies can be established many kilometers from their queens’ natal nest site. However, little is known about when and how queens disperse during their lifespan. One possible life stage when dispersal may occur, is directly after emerging from hibernation. Here, harmonic radar tracking of artificially over-wintered Bombus terrestris queens shows that they spend most of their time resting on the ground with intermittent very short flights (duration and distance). We corroborate these behaviors with observations of wild queen bees, which show similar prolonged resting periods between short flights, indicating that the behavior of our radar-monitored bees was not due to the attachment of transponders nor an artifact of the bees being commercially reared. Radar-monitored flights were not continuously directed away from the origin, suggesting that bees were not intentionally trying to disperse from their artificial emergence site. Flights did not loop back to the origin suggesting bees were not trying to remember or get back to the original release site. Most individuals dispersed from the range of the harmonic radar within less than two days and did not return. Flight directions were not different from a uniform distribution and flight lengths followed an exponential distribution, both suggesting random dispersal. A random walk model based on our observed data estimates a positive net dispersal from the origin over many flights, indicating a biased random dispersal, and estimates the net displacement of queens to be within the range of those estimated in genetic studies. We suggest that a distinct post-hibernation life history stage consisting mostly of rest with intermittent short flights and infrequent foraging fulfils the dual purpose of ovary development and dispersal prior to nest searching.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 2045-2322\", \"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-019-40355-6\", \"PMID: 30894590\", \"ISSN: 2045-2322\"]}\n",

Given this, eusocial insects provide excellent model systems for research into ageing. We tested telomerase activity and measured telomere length in Bombus terrestris, which is a primitively eusocial insect species with several distinct features compared to advanced social insects. In somatic tissues, telomerase activity was upregulated only in the fat bodies of pre-diapause queens, and this upregulation was linked to heightened DNA synthesis.

We asked whether bumblebees, Bombus terrestris, learn to avoid predators, whether learning depends on the conspicuousness of predators and whether bumblebees learn to identify predators or simply to avoid dangerous patches. To answer these questions, we allowed bumblebees to forage in an enclosed meadow of 15 artificial flowers containing a yellow female crab spider, Thomisus onustus. Flowers were yellow in half of the trials and white in the other half. Spiders could remain at the same flower throughout the experiment or swap flowers between bee foraging bouts. Of the 60 bees used in the experiment, eight were killed by the spiders and nine stopped foraging without finishing the trial. Death or refusal to forage typically occurred early in the trial. Regardless of the treatment, the probability of landing at the spider-harbouring flower increased with time. Previous encounters with heterospecific individuals can therefore be a poor source of information about their predatory nature.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1093/biolinnean/blz155\", \"ISSN: 1095-8312\", \"ISSN: 0024-4066\", \"EISSN: 1095-8312\"]}\n",

Resultant fragmentation and loss of suitable foraging habitats, combined with pesticide exposure, may increase demands on foraging, specifically the ability to collect or reach sufficient resources under such stress. Understanding effects that pesticides have on flight performance is therefore vital if we are to assess colony success in these changing landscapes. Neonicotinoids are one of the most widely used classes of pesticide across the globe, and exposure to bees has been associated with reduced foraging efficiency and homing ability. One explanation for these effects could be that elements of flight are being affected, but apart from a couple of studies on the honeybee (Apis mellifera), this has scarcely been tested. Here, we used flight mills to investigate how exposure to a field realistic (10 ppb) acute dose of imidacloprid affected flight performance of a wild insect pollinator—the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris audax. Intriguingly, observations showed exposed workers flew at a significantly higher velocity over the first ¾ km of flight. This apparent hyperactivity, however, may have a cost because exposed workers showed reduced flight distance and duration to around a third of what control workers were capable of achieving. Given that bumblebees are central place foragers, impairment to flight endurance could translate to a decline in potential forage area, decreasing the abundance, diversity, and nutritional quality of available food, while potentially diminishing pollination service capabilities.\\nUsing an experimental flight mill setup, we found that acute neonicotinoid exposure impaired flight endurance and affected flight velocity of Bombus terrestris workers.

In the case of disease risks in particular, there is conflicting evidence published by some researchers on the prevalence of pathogens in managed colonies versus audited data published by one of the main bumble bee producers. The current lack of consistent evidence makes it difficult for government regulators to make informed risk assessments, and we argue that more work is needed to demonstrate both the reproducibility of published findings and to understand the mechanisms of action of risk effects.

We aimed to determine the effects of chronic sublethal exposure of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris under laboratory conditions. The analytical standard of imidacloprid in sugar solution was used for the treatment. Verification of pesticides using UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS in the experimental bumblebees showed the presence of only two compounds, imidacloprid and imidacloprid-olefin, which were found in quantities of 0.57 ± 0.22 and 1.95 ± 0.43 ng/g, respectively. Thus, the level of the dangerous metabolite imidacloprid-olefin was 3.4-fold higher than that of imidacloprid. Label-free nanoLC-MS/MS quantitative proteomics of bumblebee heads enabled quantitative comparison of 2883 proteins, and 206 proteins were significantly influenced by the imidacloprid treatment. The next analysis revealed that the highly downregulated markers are members of the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway (KEGG: bter00900) and that imidacloprid treatment suppressed the entire mevalonate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and associated markers.

An increase in the use of commercial pollinator colonies associated with these crops may promote the spillover of managed pollinators into nearby natural habitats. There, these managed pollinators can exploit floral resources similar to those of wild pollinators, and thus increase competition for local resources. Nonetheless, managed pollinator spillover has been poorly studied and research has focused on only one species, the western honeybee (Apis mellifera). In south-western Spain, we investigated the presence, density and exploitation of floral resources by managed (Bombus terrestris) and native bumblebees (B. t. lusitanicus) in 19 Mediterranean pinewood understories across a landscape gradient of strawberry polytunnel greenhouse cover. Sampling was performed over two consecutive years in two seasons: winter, when strawberries begin flowering and farmers frequently use colonies, and spring, when there is greater availability of floral resources and wild pollinators thrive. In winter, the density of managed bumblebees in pinewoods was higher than that of native bumblebees. The presence of managed and native bumblebees in pinewoods showed contrasting patterns in relation to greenhouse cover in the landscape. The presence of managed bumblebees was positively associated with greenhouse cover, whereas that of native bumblebees was negatively associated with greenhouse cover. Overall, the presence and density of bumblebees did not differ between seasons. The two bumblebee subspecies showed similar wild flowering plant preferences, particularly in winter, when flowering plant species are scarce. We conclude that, although managed bumblebees are placed in greenhouse crops, their pollination role extends beyond these crops. Further studies are needed to assess the pollination function of managed pollinators in crops in order to reduce their spillover into natural habitats and thus, the risks posed to native pollinators.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1873-2305\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.agee.2018.11.018\", \"ISSN: 0167-8809\"]}\n",

In this study, we analyzed whole genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA‐seq data sets from head tissue of reproductive and sterile castes of the eusocial bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We found that genome‐wide methylation in B. terrestris is similar to other holometabolous insects and does not differ between reproductive castes. We did, however, find differentially methylated genes between castes, which are enriched for multiple biological processes including reproduction. However, we found no relationship between differential methylation and differential gene expression or differential exon usage between castes. Our results also indicate high intercolony variation in methylation. These findings suggest that methylation is associated with caste differences but may serve an alternate function, other than direct caste determination in this species. This study provides the first insights into the nature of a bumblebee caste‐specific methylome as well as its interaction with gene expression and caste‐specific alternative splicing, providing greater understanding of the role of methylation in phenotypic plasticity within social bee species.

Flight activity, mortality and population development (brood, colony strength and weight) of bumblebees and number of mason bee brood cells were assessed at three locations.

We detected clothianidin at low concentrations in nectar and pollen; residues in pollen were higher than in nectar but did not exceed a maximum field concentration of 2.7 µg/kg for bumblebees and 4.7 µg/kg for mason bees. Exposure did not result in significant negative impacts on bumblebee colony development and potential reproductive success of mason bees in either semi-field or field setup. During exposure bumblebees in semi-field treatment tunnels were flying less actively than in control tunnels. Bumblebee colonies in treatment tunnels weighed more than control colonies at the end of the experiment. Our findings suggest that field-realistic exposure to oilseed rape grown from clothianidin-treated seeds (10 g clothianidin/kg seeds) poses little risks to mason bees, bumblebees and their population development.

Colonies of commercially-reared honey bees and bumblebees are two of the largest groups of managed pollinators. Bumblebees in particular are increasingly used on soft fruit crops, such as strawberry, an economically important crop globally. Despite the use of commercial bumblebees in strawberry crops, there is little quantitative evidence that they provide a benefit to farmers. Given the negative impacts that commercial colonies can have on wild bee populations, it is vital that the benefits of commercial bumblebees are quantified, so reasoned management decisions can be made that provide maximum benefit to both farmers and wild bees. In this study, commercial colonies of the UK native subspecies Bombus terrestris audax were placed into June-bearer (flowering March-April, varieties ‘Malling Centenary’ and ‘Flair’) and everbearer (flowering May-June) strawberry polytunnels on a soft-fruit farm in the south east of England, and opened and closed at weekly intervals. The flower-visiting assemblage inside polytunnels was quantified, and fruit was harvested and quality assessed. In the June-bearer variety Malling Centenary, the presence of commercial bumblebees increased the amount of high commercial grade fruit by 25%. In contrast, no benefit of commercial bees on pollination or fruit quality was observed in the June-bearer variety Flair and the everbearer crop. The increase in quality of fruit in the Malling Centenary crop may be driven by the higher B. terrestris audax flower visitation rates seen in this crop in combination with varietal differences in pollination dependency. The number of flower visits by wild pollinators was not a well-supported predictor of strawberry quality, thus the benefit they provide in this system remains to be elucidated. The results presented here suggest that commercial bumblebees can greatly increase the quality and subsequent value of a strawberry crop, when deployed on a suitable variety at a time when wild pollinator numbers are low. However, the results also raise the possibility that commercial colonies do not always provide the benefits to strawberry crops that they are thought to. For growers to make informed decisions on commercial bumblebee use, further research is required into the effect of commercial bumblebees on the major strawberry varieties, in different locations and seasons. This study is an important step in gaining this understanding.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1873-2305\", \"PMID: 31481820\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.agee.2019.04.007\", \"ISSN: 1873-2305\", \"ISSN: 0167-8809\"]}\n",

An alternative to increase the almond production is the use of commercial pollinators. In this long‐term (3 years) study, the effect of the introduction of Bombus terrestris colonies on almond production was evaluated in two orchards. Two experimental designs were carried out to study the best management of this pollinator. For 2 years, all bumble bee colonies were placed in the middle of the plot and during the last year, the bumble bee colonies were distributed homogenously in the plot.

In social insects, nutrient regulation is complicated by the fact that few individuals, the foragers, must address the divergent nutritional needs of all colony members simultaneously, including other workers, the reproductives, and the brood. Here we used 3D nutritional geometry design to examine how bumblebee workers regulate their collection of 3 major macronutrients in the presence and absence of brood. We provided small colonies artificial nectars (liquid diets) and pollens (solid diets) varying in their compositions of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates during 2 weeks. Colonies given a choice between nutritionally complementary diets self-selected foods to reach a target ratio of 71% proteins, 6% carbohydrates, and 23% lipids, irrespective of the presence of brood. When confined to a single nutritionally imbalanced solid diet, colonies without brood regulated lipid collection and over-collected protein relative to this target ratio, whereas colonies with brood regulated both lipid and protein collection. This brood effect on the regulation of nutrient collection by workers suggests that protein levels are critical for larval development.

This behavior may be rare because the percentage of sugar in honeydew egested from aphids is generally well below the sugar concentration in floral nectars preferred by bumble bees.

Unlike aphid-tending ants, who glean fresh honeydew directly from the aphid anal opening, the bumble bees were collecting honeydew from leaf litter below the aphid colony. We hypothesized that honeydew collected from exposed ground surfaces was more concentrated due to evaporation under ambient conditions than that released directly from the anus (fresh honeydew). We thus monitored sugar concentrations of fresh honeydew and compared them with the concentrations of the crop contents of worker bumble bees foraging from the leaf litter. Our data show that the concentration of sugar in fresh honeydew was as much as 10% w/w lower than that collected from leaf surfaces, as measured from the crop contents of foragers. The unusually hot, dry weather in Cornwall may have enhanced evaporative concentration of honeydew while restricting floral nectar sources, thus favoring honeydew collection by\\nB.terrestris\\n, a generalist bumble bee forager.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1314-2607\", \"ISSN: 1314-2607\", \"ISSN: 1070-9428\", \"DOI: 10.3897/jhr.68.30495\"]}\n",

In eusocial insects, which live in colonies containing workers that forage for food that is mostly consumed by others, foraging decisions that reflect colony needs may also be considered at both the colony and individual level. If colony energy balance is perturbed, is the counteracting response occurring on the group level (a change in division of labor) or on the individual level (a change in individual foraging choices)? To address this, colony and individual level foraging behaviors were observed in two species of eusocial bees: the highly social honey bee Apis mellifera and the primitively eusocial bumble bee Bombus terrestris. After manipulations of protein (P) and carbohydrate (C) stores in colonies of both species, there were changes in multiple different behavioral responses including colony level (number of foragers, allocation to nectar and pollen foraging, nutrient mass foraged) and individual level (P and C concentration preference and loading during foraging). These results suggest both honey bee and bumble bee colonies balance nutrient needs through a combination of both colony level shifts in foraging allocation, as well as slight modulation of individual nutrient preferences. This study also uncovered colony level differences between the two bee species; honey bees balanced P intake while bumble bees balanced C intake. These patterns may reflect differences in life history traits such as perenniality and hoarding, traits that are developed in more highly social species. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering both group and individual level behavioral responses in foraging decisions in social animals.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 2296-701X\", \"EISSN: 2296-701X\", \"DOI: 10.3389/fevo.2019.00177\"]}\n",

Performance of their colonies depends on pollen and nectar as food resources, but flowering plants are scarce in modern agricultural landscapes. It is well‐known that semi‐natural habitats can enhance floral resources and bumblebee abundance, but the impact of different crop types and their heterogeneity at the landscape scale remains unclear.\\nWe tested the effect of two different crop types (oilseed rape [OSR] and maize) and of configurational (field border density) and compositional heterogeneity (crop diversity) on weight gain of buff‐tailed bumblebee colonies (Bombus terrestris) and the pollen diversity collected by them in 20 landscapes in Central Germany.\\nWe found that augmenting maize cover had a detrimental effect on pollen diversity collected by bumblebees, probably due to intensive management resulting in low plant diversity. This low pollen diversity translated into reduced colony growth, since colonies with high pollen diversity gained more weight than colonies with low pollen diversity.\\nIn contrast, OSR cover and configurational and compositional heterogeneity did neither affect colony growth nor pollen diversity. However, for OSR, the timing of the flowering period was important. When OSR fields had a high flower cover at the end of the OSR blooming period, colonies showed increased growth rates.\\nSynthesis and applications. Our results complement previous laboratory studies by showing that high pollen diversity leads to better colony performance under field conditions. Therefore, the maintenance of floral diversity in agricultural landscapes is crucial to ensure that bumblebees can fulfil their nutritional needs. However, the heterogeneity of crops, at least under the currently very low levels of crop rotation, does not contribute to this aim. In contrast, crop identity and timing of mass‐flowering crops turned out to be important factors, as maize reduced pollen resources, while late blooming oilseed rape (OSR) was beneficial to bumblebee colonies. Hence, maize cover per landscape should be reduced and strategies to enhance landscape wide flower diversity, especially towards and after the end of oilseed rape bloom, should be promoted to support bumblebee colonies that provide important pollination services.\\nOur results complement previous laboratory studies by showing that high pollen diversity leads to better colony performance under field conditions.

Bumble bees (Bombus terrestris), in contrast, exhibit a size‐related rather than an age‐related task allocation, and thus workers may already start foraging at two days of age. We ask how this early behavioral maturation and distinct size variation are represented at the neuronal level and focused our analysis on the mushroom bodies (MBs), brain centers associated with sensory integration, learning and memory. To test for structural neuronal changes related to age, light exposure, and body size, whole‐mount brains of age‐marked workers were dissected for synapsin immunolabeling. MB calyx volumes, densities, and absolute numbers of olfactory and visual projection neuron (PN) boutons were determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy and three‐dimensional image analyses. Dark‐reared bumble bee workers showed an early age‐related volume increase in olfactory and visual calyx subcompartments together with a decrease in PN‐bouton density during the first three days of adult life. A 12:12  h light‐dark cycle did not affect structural organization of the MB calyces compared to dark‐reared individuals. MB calyx volumes and bouton numbers positively correlated with body size, whereas bouton density was lower in larger workers.

For each bumblebee, the pollen pellets were taxonomically identified with DNA metabarcoding of the ITS2 region followed by a statistical filtering based on ROC curves to filter out underrepresented OTUs. Video cameras and network analyses were employed to investigate changes in foraging strategies and behaviour. After filtering out the false-positives, HTS metabarcoding yielded a high plant diversity in the pollen pellets; for plant identity and pollen quantity traits no differences emerged between samples from treated and from control colonies, suggesting that plant choice was influenced mainly by external factors such as the plant phenology. The colonies responded to the removal of 50% of their workers by increasing the foraging activity of the remaining workers, while only negligible changes were found in diet breadth and indices describing the structure of the pollen transport network. Therefore, a consistency in the bumblebees' feeding strategies emerges in the short term despite the lowered workforce.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"PMID: 31693676\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0224037\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

Bumblebees can, therefore, transfer learnt patterns between different sensory modalities, without needing to relearn them. We used differential conditioning techniques to explore whether cross-modal transfer of learnt patterns also occurred between visual and temperature patterns.

As legislative reassessment of neonicotinoid use occurs globally, there is an urgent need to understand the potential risk of other systemic insecticides. Sulfoxaflor, the first branded sulfoximine-based insecticide, has the same mode of action as neonicotinoids, and may potentially replace them over large geographical ranges. Here we assessed the impact of acute sulfoxaflor exposure on performance in two paradigms that have previously been used to illustrate negative impacts of neonicotinoid pesticides on bee learning and memory. We assayed whether acute sulfoxaflor exposure influences (a) olfactory conditioning performance in both bumblebees (\\n) and honeybees (\\n), using a proboscis extension reflex assay, and (b) working memory performance of bumblebees, using a radial-arm maze.

However, our understanding of the molecular‐genetic pathways that lead to such effects is limited, as is our knowledge of how effects may differ between colony members. To understand what genes and pathways are affected by exposure of bumblebee workers and queens to neonicotinoid pesticides, we implemented a transcriptome‐wide gene expression study. We chronically exposed Bombus terrestriscolonies to either clothianidin or imidacloprid at field‐realistic concentrations while controlling for factors including colony social environment and worker age. We reveal that genes involved in important biological processes including mitochondrial function are differentially expressed in response to neonicotinoid exposure. Additionally, clothianidin exposure had stronger effects on gene expression amplitude and alternative splicing than imidacloprid. Finally, exposure affected workers more strongly than queens.

Some nectar metabolites, for example, reduce parasite infections in bees [4–7].

Existing studies are, however, limited by (1) a lack of mechanistic insights into how phytochemicals affect pollinator diseases and (2) the restriction to few, commercially available chemicals, thereby potentially neglecting plants with the biggest antiparasitic effects. To rapidly identify plants with the greatest potential as natural bee medicines, we developed a bioactivity-directed fractionation assay for nectar metabolites. We evaluated 17 important nectar plants against the bumblebee pathogen Crithidia bombi (Trypanosomatidae) [13–17]. The most bioactive species was heather (Calluna vulgaris), the second most productive UK nectar plant [10]. We identified 4-(3-oxobut-1-enylidene)-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-one (callunene) from heather nectar as a potent inhibitor of C. bombi. Wild bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) foraging on heather ingest callunene at concentrations causing complete C. bombi inhibition. Feeding on callunene was prophylactic against infections. We show that C. bombi establishes infections by flagellar anchoring to the ileum epithelium. Short-term callunene exposure induced flagellum loss in C. bombi choanomastigotes, resulting in a loss of infectivity.

In this review, we present additional new data showing hybrid production between introduced B. terrestris and native B. ignitus in Honshu. Interspecific mating with introduced B. terrestris disrupts the reproduction of native B. h. sapporoensis and B. ignitus, which belong to the same subgenus of Bombus, through inviable egg production.

Simultaneously, the mating frequencies for queens of B. terrestris have increased, suggesting that polyandry might evolve in response to the extent of RI between B. terrestris and B. h. sapporoensis. To suppress the population size of B. terrestris in Hokkaido, two methods have been proposed: the mass release of B. h. sapporoensis males to induce RI between the two species and the spraying of insecticides against foraging workers so that the workers will carry the insecticides back to their colonies, killing the immature bees within the colonies.

Here, we estimate rates of crossovers and gene conversions in 22 colonies of the honeybee,\\n, and 9 colonies of the bumblebee,\\n, using direct sequencing of 299 haploid drone offspring. We confirm that both species have extremely elevated crossover rates, with higher rates measured in the highly eusocial honeybee than the primitively social bumblebee.

One such mechanism is diapause, a period of dormancy typically found in nematodes, fish, crustaceans and insects. This state is a key life-history event characterised by arrested development, suppressed metabolism and increased stress tolerance and allows an organism to avoid prolonged periods of harsh and inhospitable environmental conditions. For some species, diapause is preceded by mating which can have a profound effect on female behaviour, physiology and key biological processes, including immunity. However, our understanding of how mating impacts long-term immunity and whether these effects persist throughout diapause is currently limited. To address this, we explored molecular changes in the haemolymph of the ecologically important pollinator, the buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris. B. terrestris queens mate prior to entering diapause, a non-feeding period of arrested development that can last 6-9 months. Using mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, we quantified changes in the pre-diapause queen haemolymph after mating, as well as the subsequent protein expression of mated queens during and post-diapause.\\nOur analysis identified distinct proteome profiles associated with diapause preparation, maintenance and termination. More specifically, mating pre-diapause was followed by an increase in the abundance of antimicrobial peptides, key effectors of the immune system. Furthermore, we identified the elevated abundance of these proteins to be maintained throughout diapause. This finding was in contrast to the general reduction observed in immune proteins during diapause suggestive of selective immune priming and expression during diapause. Diapause also affected the expression of proteins involved in cuticular maintenance, olfaction, as well as proteins of unknown function, which may have roles in diapause regulation.\\nOur results provide clear molecular evidence for the consequences and benefits of mating at the immune level as it precedes the selective increased abundance of antimicrobial peptides that are sustained throughout diapause. In addition, our results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which bumblebees prepare for, survive, and recover from diapause, insights that may have implications for our general understanding of these processes in other insect groups.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1471-2164\", \"EISSN: 1471-2164\", \"PMID: 31823732\", \"DOI: 10.1186/s12864-019-6314-9\"]}\n",

How pollinators' foraging choices and success vary along a floral complexity gradient has received less attention. Here we investigated, using real flowers of increasing morphological complexity, how complex flowers are chosen and handled by naïve and experienced bumblebees when presented along with simple ones. Intact flowers of Tecoma x ‘Orange Jubilee’ (Bignoniaceae), Antirrhinum majus (Plantaginaceae) and Lupinus pilosus (Fabaceae) represented a gradient of increasing morphological complexity. We manipulated some flowers of each species to look simple with a readily accessible food reward, while keeping their colour and odour unchanged. Bombus terrestris workers were given four simple and four complex flowers of a single species with equal rewards in choice assays in a flight room. Sixty per cent of naïve foragers chose a complex flower on their first visit to all three flower species arrays. Experienced bees visited complex flower types of all three species but had lower feeding success and longer handling times on the more complex species. Thus, the bees' foraging efficiency on the complex option decreased with increasing complexity of the flowers, while individual variation in feeding success on the complex option was increased.

However, agricultural intensification and loss of semi-natural habitat may have adverse effects on colony performance. While mass-flowering crops may serve as food sources, landscapes dominated by intensive agriculture may be a poor bumblebee habitat compared to landscapes dominated by semi-natural habitat, such as forests and species-rich grasslands.\\nObjectives\\nWe investigated the effect of different land use classes on bumblebee colony performance at two periods of time during the flying season. We expected mass-flowering crops to have a positive influence on colony performance during flowering. After mass-flowering, presence of semi-natural habitat was hypothesized to be essential for colony development.\\nMethods\\nWe placed artificial colonies of\\nBombus terrestris\\nin 28 apple and pear orchards during and after mass-flowering. We measured colony growth and took pollen samples from foraging workers. Causal relationships between land-use, pollen quality, amount of pollen collected and colony performance were analyzed.\\nResults\\nContrary to our expectations, we found a negative correlation between orchard cover and amount of pollen collected in spring, during mass-flowering, resulting in a lower colony performance. During mass-flowering, colony performance and pollen diversity were positively correlated with cover of open semi-natural habitat, while after mass-flowering, colony performance was positively correlated with forest cover. After mass-flowering, pollen sources were more diverse and colony growth was related to land use classes at a larger spatial scale, indicating that bumblebees foraged further. We did not find a correlation between the performances of colonies at one specific site that were placed during and after mass-flowering.\\nConclusions\\nLandscapes dominated by mass-flowering orchards represent inferior habitats for bumblebees during flowering. Heterogenous landscapes, containing a mix of various types of semi-natural habitat increase the habitat quality for bumblebees. We advise to maintain these diverse patches of semi-natural habitat, as mass-flowering crops alone are insufficient to support bumblebee colonies.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0921-2973\", \"EISSN: 1572-9761\", \"DOI: 10.1007/s10980-019-00836-5\"]}\n",

We experimentally tested key elements of this model in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. In colonies from which queens were sequentially removed, queen tenure was significantly negatively associated with worker male production, confirming that workers gain direct fitness by usurping the queen. In unmanipulated colonies, queen fecundity decreased significantly over the latter part of the colony cycle, confirming that workers’ indirect fitness from maintaining queens declines over time. Finally, in an experiment simulating loss of queen fecundity by removal of queens’ eggs, worker-to-queen aggression increased significantly and aggressive workers were significantly more likely to become egg layers, consistent with workers monitoring queen fecundity to assess the net benefit of future reproduction.

To examine how metabolic requirements and oxidative stress vary between species, we explored the variation in flight mechanics and metabolism of the honeybee (Apis mellifera), bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), and German wasp (Vespula germanica). Wing structures and flight muscle properties were compared alongside measures of oxygen flux and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from permeabilised flight muscle. The wasp wing structure is best adapted for carrying heavy loads, with the highest wing aspect ratio, lowest wing loading, and highest flight muscle ratio. Bumblebees had the lowest wing aspect ratio and flight muscle ratio, and highest wing loading. Although wasps also had the highest rates of oxygen consumption during oxidative phosphorylation, oxygen consumption did not increase in the wasp muscle following chemical uncoupling, while it did for the two bee species. While mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH) mediated oxygen flux was greatest in wasps, muscle fibres released greater amounts of ROS through this pathway.

In conclusion, we show the existence of different patterns in ingestion of protein and sugar between well-fed and food-stressed bumblebee colonies.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-00681-w\", \"EISSN: 1420-9098\", \"ISSN: 0020-1812\"]}\n",

Rates of recombination vary on several scales, both within genomes and between individuals, and this variation is affected by both genetic and environmental factors. Social insects have extremely high rates of recombination, although the evolutionary causes of this are not known. Here, we estimate rates of crossovers and gene conversions in 22 colonies of the honeybee, Apis mellifera, and 9 colonies of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, using direct sequencing of 299 haploid drone offspring. We confirm that both species have extremely elevated crossover rates, with higher rates measured in the highly eusocial honeybee than the primitively social bumblebee. There are also significant differences in recombination rate between subspecies of honeybee. There is substantial variation in genome-wide recombination rate between individuals of both A. mellifera and B. terrestris and the distribution of these rates overlap between species. A large proportion of interindividual variation in recombination rate is heritable, which indicates the presence of variation in trans-acting factors that influence recombination genome-wide. We infer that levels of crossover interference are significantly lower in honeybees compared to bumblebees, which may be one mechanism that contributes to higher recombination rates in honeybees. We also find a significant increase in recombination rate with distance from the centromere, mirrored by methylation differences. We detect a strong transmission bias due to GC-biased gene conversion associated with noncrossover gene conversions. Our results shed light on the mechanistic causes of extreme rates of recombination in social insects and the genetic architecture of recombination rate variation.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1943-2631\", \"PMID: 33956118\"]}\n",

The influence of various organic substrates on mitochondrial respiration in the presence or absence of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was investigated. We demonstrated that pyruvate is the optimal substrate for the coupled respiration. A combination of pyruvate and glutamate is required for the maximal respiration rate. We also show that succinate oxidation does not support the oxidative phosphorylation and the generation of membrane potential. We also studied the production of reactive oxygen species by isolated mitochondria. The greatest production of H2O2 (as a percentage of the rate of oxygen consumed) in the absence of ADP was observed during the respiration supported by α‐glycerophosphate, malate, and a combination of malate with another NAD‐linked substrate.

We analysed the influence of pollen grain properties (diameter, spine length, spine density) on the collectability of echinate (spiny) pollen by bumble bees (\\nBombus terrestris\\n).

While pollen foragers did not shift to nectar collection but seized visiting flowers with uncollectable pollen, nectar foragers performed regular foraging bouts on these plants. Pollen that is uncollectable for corbiculate bees limits pollen depletion by generalist bumble bees and probably also honey bees while maintaining them as pollinators, which is an effective solution to the pollen dilemma.

Nevertheless, some animals can reduce sleep for increasing foraging time [4], under predation risk [5–8], during seasonal migration [9–11], or for having greater mating opportunities [12, 13]. Here, we tested the hypothesis that social bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) workers give up sleep for improving brood care. We combined video recordings, detailed behavioral analyses, sleep-deprivation experiments, and response-threshold assessments to characterize the sleep behavior of worker bees and showed that immobility bouts of ≥5 min provide a reliable proxy for sleep. We next used this index to study sleep with an automated video-based activity monitoring system. We found that isolated workers severely reduce sleep time in the presence of both larvae that need to be fed and pupae that do not. Reduced sleep was also correlated with around-the-clock activity and wax-pot building, which are typical for nest-founding mother queens. Cocoons, from which we removed the pupae, elicited a similar but transient sleep loss in tending workers, suggesting that the pupa effect on sleep is mediated by pheromonal signals. Sleep time increased following brood removal but remained lower compared to control bees, suggesting that the brood modulated sleep need. This first evidence for brood modulation of sleep in an insect suggests that plasticity in sleep can evolve as a mechanism to improve care for dependent juveniles, even in social insect workers that do not care for their own offspring.\\n•Bumble bee workers show the essential characteristics of sleep•Sleep is reduced in the presence of pupae that do not need to be fed•Empty cocoons induce transient sleep loss, suggesting involvement of brood pheromones•Worker bees give up sleep to care for offspring that are not their own\\nNagari et al. report that bumble bee workers reduce sleep in the presence of larvae that need to be fed or pupae that do not.

One proposed mechanism for these negative effects is impairment to bees’ ability to learn floral associations. However, the effects of neonicotinoids on learning performance have largely been addressed using a single protocol, where immobilized bees learn an association based on a single sensory modality. We thus have an incomplete understanding of how these pesticides affect bee learning in more naturalistic foraging scenarios. We carried out the first free-foraging study into the effects of acute exposure of a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) on bumblebees’ (\\nBombus impatiens\\n) ability to learn associations with visual stimuli. We uncovered dose-dependent detrimental effects on motivation to initiate foraging, amount of nectar collected, and initiation of subsequent foraging bouts. However, we did not find any impairment to bees’ ability to learn visual associations. While not precluding the possibility that other forms of learning are impaired, our findings suggest that some of the major effects of acute neonicotinoid exposure on foraging performance may be due to motivational and/or sensory impairments. In light of these findings, we discuss more broadly how pesticide effects on pollinator cognition might be studied.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 30886154\", \"EISSN: 2045-2322\", \"ISSN: 2045-2322\", \"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-019-39701-5\"]}\n",

If the efficiency of commercial colonies at providing pollination services could be increased, it would have implications for agricultural outputs. Commercial colonies are sold with an internal nectar reservoir on which bees can forage from within the nest. Nectar stores in naturally-produced nectar pots of colonies can affect forager recruitment and activity outside the nest. Thus, it is possible that artificial nectar reservoirs could impact the foraging activity of colonies. To investigate this, commercial Bombus terrestris audax colonies were placed in a university parkland campus. Colonies were split into three treatment groups: those with (1) access to an unaltered nectar reservoir; (2) access to a diluted reservoir; and (3) no reservoir access. Foraging observations were made for all colonies over a 19-day period. The mass of each colony was measured and demographic data were collected. Colonies with diluted reservoirs had 131% and 39% more bees entering and leaving than colonies with no reservoir access and unaltered reservoirs respectively. Both treatments with access to a nectar reservoir gained more mass, had a higher proportion of pollen foraging bees, and had more workers, males, larvae and pupae, than colonies with no access to a reservoir. These results demonstrate that manipulating the availability and concentration of internal nectar reservoirs of commercial B. terrestris colonies significantly affects the number of bees entering and leaving the colony. Dilution of the nectar reservoir could be a strategy for increasing the pollination services commercial colonies provide to crops. Further research in commercial crops is required before such a strategy could be implemented on farms.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1920-7603\", \"ISSN: 1920-7603\", \"DOI: 10.26786/1920-7603(2018)21\"]}\n",

For one, much of the ecological research has assumed that the environment changes in a linear fashion from the city core to the city edges, whereas in reality the environments within the cities are highly heterogeneous. Furthermore, studies on species responses to these highly variable ecosystems are often based on interspecific mean trait values, which ignore the potential for high levels of intraspecific variation among individuals in key functional traits.\\nThe current study investigated intraspecific functional trait differences for four functional traits associated with body size, mobility and resource selection among rural and urban populations of two common bumblebee species, Bombus pascuorum and Bombus lapidarius, in urban centres and adjacent rural areas in Switzerland.\\nWe document shifts in functional traits towards smaller individuals and higher multidimensional trait variation in urban populations compared to rural conspecifics of both species.

On average for observations during the first week after spraying, 17 and 40% less honey bees (P = .03) and 26 and 20% less bumble bees (P = .36) were observed on plots sprayed with the pyrethroids lambda-cyhalothrin and alpha-cypermethrin, respectively, than on unsprayed control plots.

Follow-up studies in 2014-2016 focused on the effect of thiacloprid on bumble bee colony development in commercially reared nests of Bombus terrestris placed into red clover seed crops at the start of flowering. Unsprayed control crops were compared with crops sprayed either at the bud stage or when 18-44% of flower heads were in full bloom. Chemical analyses of adult bumble bees showed that thiacloprid was taken up in bees when crops were sprayed during flowering, but not detected when crops were sprayed at the bud stage. The bumble bees in late-sprayed crops also developed weaker colonies than in unsprayed crops. Dead bees with a high internal concentration of thiacloprid were found in one crop sprayed during the night at 35% flowering.

However, current government regulatory agencies do not require the assessment of insecticide toxicity on bee species other than the honey bee, even though previous studies have demonstrated that sensitivity to insecticides is not likely to be generalizable from honey bees to non- managed bee species. Replicating standardized protocols and testing five different doses of thiacloprid on individual caged bees, we assessed the acute contact toxicity by calculating mortality and the lethal dose (LDso) value for three bee species with different life history traits: Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris, and Osmia bicornis.

And 2) Does pollinator management increase pollinator visitation to, and yield of, cucurbit crops? These accounts of cucurbit pollination demonstrate that wild bee species such as Bombus terrestris, B. impatiens and Eucera spp. were frequently able to fulfil the pollination requirements of multiple cucurbit species. However, pollinator behaviour, pollen deposition on stigmas, and pollinators’ contribution to yield vary between cucurbit species and study site. Nonetheless, the provision of additional floral resources at both field and farm scales may help to encourage pollination of cucurbit species whilst supporting pollinators’ nutritional requirements beyond those already provided by the cucurbit crop.

To assess the effects of farming system on bee colony success (relative growth rate and fecundity) and worker condition (lipid content and wing wear), we placed 60 mini-colonies of Bombus impatiens in six conventional and six organic spring wheat fields near Big Sandy, Montana, USA over two growing seasons. Consistent with our expectations, we found that flower density and forb richness were positively associated with colony relative growth rate and fecundity. Similarly, flower density, forb richness, and the relative growth rate and fecundity of B. impatiens colonies were greater in organic fields when compared to conventional fields. Workers from organic fields had lower mean wing wear and marginally greater average body lipid content. However, there were no differences in the number of reproductives (queens, workers, and males) between two systems. Lastly, though the overall composition of colony-collected pollen was not different across the farming systems, colony-collected pollen species richness was greater in organic fields in one of the two sampled growing seasons.

Here we examine whether pollinators contribute to the maintenance of pollen colour variation in C. americana.\\nIn a flight cage experiment, we assessed whether Bombus impatiens foragers can use pollen colour as a reward cue.

In natural populations, the specialist pollinator, Megachile campanulae, displayed a strong and consistent preference for purple-pollen plants regardless of morph frequency. Megachile also exhibited a bias toward pollen-bearing male-phase flowers, and this bias was more pronounced for purple pollen. The other main pollinators, Bombus spp. and small bees, did not display pollen colour preference.\\nPrevious research found that Megachile removes twice as much pollen per visit as other bees and can deplete pollen from natural populations. Taken together, these results suggest that Megachile could reduce the reproductive success of plants with purple pollen, resulting in the prevalence of light-coloured pollen in eastern populations of C. americana.

Here we examined the role of brood in regulating worker reproduction in Bombus impatiens, an annual eusocial species whose reproduction is monopolized by the queen via an unknown mechanism. We found that the presence of young larvae reduced workers' egg laying, whereas the presence of pupae stimulated egg laying. The effect of young larvae was quantity dependent, with nearly complete suppression of egg laying in cages containing a pair of workers and more than 10 young larvae, and replicable regardless of worker age, relatedness to brood or brood parentage/sex. The findings that any larvae can regulate worker reproduction in this simple, yet eusocial, species highlight the role of brood in the evolution of advanced eusocial insects as a mechanism for regulating worker sterility. These findings also provide the first holistic explanation for the regulation of worker reproduction in B. impatiens, suggesting that the queen inhibits worker reproduction through her brood.\\n•Presence of young larvae inhibited worker egg laying in B. impatiens.•Presence of pupae stimulated worker egg laying.•Larval effects were independent of relatedness, brood parentage or its sex.•Larval effect was quantity dependent.•Brood care plays an important role in the evolution of sociality.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1095-8282\", \"ISSN: 0003-3472\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.06.004\"]}\n",

Among the greatest threats to wild bumble bee populations worldwide, many of which are declining, is a loss of floral resource abundance and diversity in the landscapes they inhabit. We examined how composition of pollen diet impacts early nesting success in laboratory-reared queens of the bumble bee Bombus impatiens. Specifically, we provided queens and their young nests with one of three pollen diets, each of which was dominated by a single pollen type, and explored how this diet treatment influenced the length of time until queens initiated nests, total counts of brood in the nest at the end of the experiment (8 wk later), and the size and weight of adult offspring produced. We found that the amount of later-stage brood (pupae and/or adults) produced by recently-initiated nests was strongly impacted by pollen diet. For example, on average 66% fewer later-stage brood were found in nests provided with the Cistus pollen Linnaeus (Cistaceae), relative to the predominantly Asteraceae pollen.This finding suggests that particular pollen diet compositions may delay larval growth, which delays colony development and may ultimately be detrimental for young nests.

However, we found that absence versus receipt of a pollen reward did lead to a predictable behavioral response, which depended on bee size. Finally, we found some evidence of mechanical constraints, in that flower mass affected sonication acceleration (but not frequency) through an interaction with bee size. In general, larger bees showed more flexibility in sonication frequency and acceleration, potentially reflecting a size-based constraint on the range over which smaller bees can modify frequency and acceleration.

In contrast, bee colonies placed within watermelon decreased in colony weight, number of workers and immature bees, and individual bee weight compared to control colonies. Blueberry appeared to provide bees with sufficient nectar and pollen, whereas watermelon may not have provided adequate resources for the bees. Bees foraging within watermelon were probably forced to search for other sources of pollen and nectar, resulting in colony health parameter declines.

The aim of this study was to investigate the habitat use, nesting phenology, and key food plants of spring bumble bee queens. Through 108 nonlethal surveys of bumble bee queens in spring 2018, researchers observed 451 nest seeking and 555 foraging queens of nine species in Ohio, U.S.A.

In accordance queen abundance and diversity increased with the proportion of forest in the surrounding landscape. The proportion of row crops and urban areas negatively influenced queen diversity and the number of nest seekers, respectively. Through a literature review, the earliest emergence dates for each species were compared for 12 datasets to establish an order of species emergence in northeastern North America.

Initiatives to improve and restore pollinator habitat are increasingly popular. However, to most effectively conserve pollinators, we need a better understanding of which habitats limit their survival and fitness at the landscape scale. Our study examined performance and fitness of the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens (Cresson), in four common landscapes for bees (natural, suburban, conventional agriculture, and organic agriculture). In the summers of 2016 and 2017, 64 bumble bee colonies per year were deployed across 16 sites (4 sites in each landscape type in each year) and their growth (weight and bee abundance), fitness (caste production), and survival were monitored weekly. Colonies in suburban sites in 2016, but not 2017, were lighter, produced fewer worker and drone cells, and experienced queen death more quickly than colonies in natural and agricultural landscapes. The performance and fitness of colonies in natural, organic agricultural, and conventional agricultural landscapes in both years were similar. Additionally, across all landscape types, the proportion of developed land and impervious surface were significantly negatively associated with colony performance in 2016. Thus, our results suggested that suburban landscapes are suboptimal for B. impatiens compared to natural and agricultural landscapes, and that this effect differs across years, potentially due to climactic differences. Future research is needed to identify the mechanisms responsible for reduced performance of bumble bee colonies in suburban landscapes, especially regarding floral resources and pesticide and pathogen stress. Such information could direct specific actions to improve suburban habitat for pollinators.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1873-2305\", \"ISSN: 0167-8809\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.agee.2019.106594\"]}\n",

Bee deaths have been attributed, with inadequate evidence, to toxicity from mannose in nectar or starvation due to low nectar in late blooming linden. Here, we investigated both factors via untargeted metabolomic analyses of nectar from five T. cordata trees beneath which crawling/dead bumble bees (B. vosnesenskii) were observed, and of thoracic muscle of 28 healthy foraging and 29 crawling bees collected from linden trees on cool mornings (< 30°C). Nectar contained the pyridine alkaloid trigonelline, a weak acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, but no mannose. Principal component analysis of muscle metabolites produced distinct clustering of healthy and crawling bees, with significant differences (P<0.05) in 34 of 123 identified metabolites. Of these, TCA (Krebs) cycle intermediates were strongly represented (pathway analysis; P<0.01), suggesting that the central metabolism is affected in crawling bees. Hence, we propose the following explanation: when ambient temperature is low, bees with energy deficit are unable to maintain the thoracic temperature required for flight, and consequently fall, crawl, and ultimately, die. Energy deficit could occur when bees continue to forage on linden despite limited nectar availability either due to loyalty to a previously energy-rich source or trigonelline-triggered memory/learning impairment, documented earlier with other alkaloids. Thus, the combination of low temperature and nectar volume, resource fidelity, and alkaloids in nectar could explain the unique phenomenon of bumble bee mortality associated with linden.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 31291287\", \"DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0218406\", \"EISSN: 1932-6203\", \"ISSN: 1932-6203\"]}\n",

Therefore, local species abundances were measured for bumblebee species at four locations in Belgium and two locations in Estonia during bumblebee foraging years 2013-2017. These locations and countries were chosen to ensure the greatest possible variance in both local abundances and population trends for these species. Hence, genetic diversity levels were obtained for seven species by genotyping collected specimens with 16 microsatellites. Our results showed that the observed patterns in genetic diversity did not depend on local species abundance. So, although declining bumblebee species can become locally abundant, they will still show lower genetic diversity levels than stable species. This result implies that measuring bumblebees' local abundance cannot be used to directly determine the health status of a population. Furthermore, this result has also major impact on future conservation strategies as increasing the genetic diversity levels of declining species will be very difficult, and habitat quality should be high to maintain their populations, otherwise these species are doomed to disappear first.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.3389/fgene.2019.01262\", \"ISSN: 1664-8021\", \"PMID: 31921301\", \"EISSN: 1664-8021\"]}\n",

We quantified floral richness and surrounding land cover and assessed their effects on bumble bee density and colony representation using OLS regression.

Sites with high meadow interspersion in the surrounding landscape had lower colony representation (i.e., detection rate), suggesting some dilution effect. Colony density and detection did not change between the pre- and post-bloom period and resource pulse, even after statistically controlling for important landscape-scale effects. Yet, relative increase in colony density, was best explained by increased floral richness and decreased open-shrub bog.

However, the spatial ecology of B. hypnorum has not previously been investigated. To address this issue, and to investigate whether specific features of the spatial ecology of B. hypnorum are associated with its rapid range expansion, we used 14 microsatellite markers to estimate worker foraging distance, nest density, between‐year lineage survival rate and isolation by distance in a representative UK B. hypnorum population. After assigning workers to colonies based on full or half sibship, we estimated the mean colony‐specific worker foraging distance as 103.6 m, considerably less than values reported from most other bumble bee populations. Estimated nest density was notably high (2.56 and 0.72 colonies ha−1 in 2014 and 2015, respectively), estimated between‐year lineage survival rate was 0.07, and there was no evidence of fine‐scale isolation by distance. In addition, genotyping stored sperm dissected from sampled queens confirmed polyandry in this population (mean minimum mating frequency of 1.7 males per queen).

Understanding potential synergies between these two important drivers is needed to improve predictive models of the future effects of climate change on pollinator declines. Here, bumblebee colony bioassays were used to evaluate the interactive effects of heat stress, a reduction of dietary resource quality, and colony size. Using a total of 117 colonies, we applied a fully crossed experiment to test the effect of three dietary quality levels under three levels of heat stress with two colony sizes. Both nutritional and heat stress reduced colony development resulting in a lower investment in offspring production. Small colonies were much more sensitive to heat and nutritional stresses than large ones, possibly because a higher percentage of workers helps maintain social homeostasis. Strikingly, the effects of heat stress were far less pronounced for small colonies fed with suitable diets. Overall, our study suggests that landscape management actions that ensure access to high-quality resources could reduce the impacts of heat stress on bee decline.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 2045-2322\", \"PMID: 31467366\", \"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-019-49025-z\", \"ISSN: 2045-2322\"]}\n",

Flies are known to have a complex visual system, including 4 spectral classes of photoreceptors that contribute to the perception of color. Our current understanding of how color signals are perceived by flies is based on data for the blowfly Lucilia sp., which after being conditioned to rewarded monochromatic light stimuli, showed evidence of a categorical color visual system. The resulting opponent fly color space has 4 distinct categories, and has been used to interpret how some fly pollinators may perceive flower colors. However, formal proof that flower flies (Syrphidae) only use a simple, categorical color process remains outstanding. In free-flying experiments, we tested the hoverfly Eristalis tenax, a Batesian mimic of the honeybee, that receives its nutrition by visiting flowers. Using a range of broadband similar–dissimilar color stimuli previously used to test color perception in pollinating hymenopteran species, we evaluated if there are steep changes in behavioral choices with continuously increasing color differences as might be expected by categorical color processing. Our data revealed that color choices by the hoverfly are mediated by a continuous monotonic function. Thus, these flies did not use a categorical processing, but showed evidence of a color discrimination function similar to that observed in several bee species. We therefore empirically provide data for the minimum color distance that can be discriminated by hoverflies in fly color space, enabling an improved understanding of plant–pollinator interactions with a non-model insect species.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 2058-5888\", \"DOI: 10.1093/cz/zoz008\", \"ISSN: 1674-5507\", \"EISSN: 2396-9814\", \"ISSN: 2396-9814\", \"PMID: 31413720\", \"ISSN: 2058-5888\"]}\n",

However, honey bees and non-Apis bees may differ in their susceptibility and exposure to pesticides. In 2017, a workshop (‘Pesticide Exposure Assessment Paradigm for Non-Apis Bees’) was held to assess if honey bee risk assessment frameworks are reflective of non-Apis bee pesticide exposure. In this article, we summarize the workshop discussions on bumble bees (Bombus spp.). We review the life history and foraging behavior of bumble bees and honey bees and discuss how these traits may influence routes and levels of exposure for both taxa. Overall, the major pesticide exposure routes for bumble bees and honey bees are similar; however, bumble bees face additional exposure routes (direct exposure of foraging queens and exposure of larvae and adults to soil residues). Furthermore, bumble bees may receive comparatively higher pesticide doses via contact or oral exposure. We conclude that honey bee pesticide risk assessments may not always be protective of bumble bees, especially queens, in terms of exposure. Data needed to reliably quantify pesticide exposure for bumble bees (e.g., food consumption rates, soil residue levels) are lacking. Addressing these knowledge gaps will be crucial before bumble bee exposure can be incorporated into the pesticide risk assessment process.

Herein, we investigated whether the spread of the invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera affects Bombus pascuorum population regarding parasite prevalence, genetic structure, and nest density in Belgium. While no difference in bumble bee genetic structure was detected between invaded and uninvaded sites, we show that I. glandulifera occurrence was significantly correlated with a decrease in the prevalence of Apicystis bombi but not the prevalence of three other parasite species (i.e., Crithidia bombi, Nosema bombi, Nosema ceranae, and Nosema sp.). Regarding our investigations, this effect was likely not due to variation in local bumble bee population fitness before I. glandulifera flowering, nor to the relative abundance of other pollinators such as Apis mellifera, but the unique chemical composition (i.e., polyphenol rich) of the pollen of I. glandulifera remained as an interesting hypothesis. Whereas B. pascuorum queens probably colonize all the potential nesting sites in an area, invaded by I. glandulifera or not, the abundance of polyphenol ampelopsin in pollen from I. glandulifera pollen might reduce local parasite prevalence.

Reliable predictions of the types of changes that can be expected in pest insect genomes and fitness, and of their impacts on the fate of species and populations remain elusive.

Population dips have specifically been noted for both managed and feral bee species. The simultaneous increased cultivation of bee-dependent agricultural crops has given rise to additional concern. As a result, there has been a surge in scientific research investigating the potential stressors impacting bees. A group of environmental and anthropogenic stressors negatively impacting bees has been isolated. Habitat destruction has diminished the availability of bee floral resources and nest habitats, while massive monoculture plantings have limited bee access to a variety of pollens and nectars. The rapid spread and increased resistance buildup of various bee parasites, pathogens, and pests to current control methods are implicated in deteriorating bee health. Similarly, many pesticides that are widely applied on agricultural crops and within beehives are toxic to bees. The global distribution of honey bee colonies (including queens with attendant bees) and bumble bee colonies from crop to crop for pollination events has been linked with increased pathogen stress and increased competition with native bee species for limited resources. Climatic alterations have disrupted synchronous bee emergence with flower blooming and reduced the availability of diverse floral resources, leading to bee physiological adaptations. Interactions amongst multiple stressors have created colossal maladies hitting bees at one time, and in some cases delivering additive impacts. Initiatives including the development of wild flower plantings and assessment of pesticide toxicity to bees have been undertaken in efforts to ameliorate current bee declines.

However, effects of temperature‐driven changes in gut microbiota on resistance to parasites remain unexplored. We examined the temperature dependence of infection and gut bacterial communities in bumble bees infected with the trypanosomatid parasite Crithidia bombi. Infection intensity decreased by over 80% between 21 and 37°C. Temperatures of peak infection were lower than predicted based on parasite growth in vitro, consistent with mismatches in thermal performance curves of hosts, parasites and gut symbionts. Gut bacterial community size and composition exhibited slight but significant, non‐linear, and taxon‐specific responses to temperature. Abundance of total gut bacteria and of Orbaceae, both negatively correlated with infection in previous studies, were positively correlated with infection here. Prevalence of the bee pathogen‐containing family Enterobacteriaceae declined with temperature, suggesting that high temperature may confer protection against diverse gut pathogens. Our results indicate that resistance to infection reflects not only the temperature dependence of host and parasite performance, but also temperature‐dependent activity of gut bacteria. The thermal ecology of gut parasite‐symbiont interactions may be broadly relevant to infectious disease, both in ectothermic organisms that inhabit changing climates, and in endotherms that exhibit fever‐based immunity.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1462-2920\", \"DOI: 10.1111/1462-2920.14805\", \"ISSN: 1462-2920\", \"ISSN: 1462-2912\", \"PMID: 31573120\"]}\n",

Bees make up a diverse insect group that provides critical pollination services to both managed and wild ecosystems. Accordingly, they display a diversity of behaviors and vary greatly in their lifestyles and phenologies, such as their timing of emergence, degree of sociality, and foraging and nesting behaviors. Some of these factors may lead to disparate or variable routes of exposure when compared to honey bees. For those that possess life histories that are distinct from A. mellifera, further risk assessments may be warranted. In January 2017, 40 bee researchers, representative of regulatory agencies, academia, and agrochemical industries, gathered to discuss the current state of science on pesticide exposure to non-Apis bees and to determine how well honey bee exposure estimates, implemented by different regulatory agencies, may be protective for non-Apis bees. Workshop participants determined that although current risk assessment procedures for honey bees are largely conservative, several routes of exposure are unique to non-Apis bees and warranted further investigation. In this forum article, we discuss these key routes of exposure relevant to non-Apis bees and identify important research gaps that can help inform future bee risk assessment decisions.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 30508116\", \"DOI: 10.1093/ee/nvy103\", \"EISSN: 1938-2936\", \"ISSN: 0046-225X\"]}\n",

In light of the development of specific odorant attractants to be used in sustainable control strategies, we carried out both behavioural assays and chemical analyses to investigate the possibility that, in the invasive population of V. velutina nigrithorax, reproductive females emit volatile pheromones to attract males, as demonstrated in a Chinese non-invasive population. We focused on the secretions produced by sternal and venom glands; because of the volatility and complexity of their composition, both of them could potentially allow an attraction and a species-specific response, decreasing therefore non-target species by-catches. Results of chemical analyses and behavioural assays showed that venom volatiles, although population-specific, are unlikely candidates as male attractants since they do not differ in composition or in quantity between reproductive females and workers and do not attract males. Conversely, sternal gland secretion differs between female castes for the presence of some ketoacids exclusive of gynes already reported as sex pheromones for the non-invasive subspecies V. velutina auraria. Despite such a difference, males are attracted by the sternal gland secretion of both workers and gynes.

We investigate how host and bacterial genotypes influence colonization of a core coevolved microbiota member in bumble bees. The hindgut colonizing Snodgrassella alvi confers direct benefits, but, as an early colonizer, also facilitates the further development of a healthy microbiota. Due to predominantly vertical transmission promoting tight evolution between colonization factors of bacteria and host lineages, we predict that genotype-by-genotype interactions will determine successful colonization. Germ-free adult bees from seven bumble bee colonies (host genotypic units) were inoculated with one of six genetically distinct strains of S. alvi. Subsequent colonization within host and microbe genotypes combinations ranged from 0 to 100 %, and an interaction between host and microbe genotypes determined colonization success.

We hypothesized that strawberry nectar and pollen quality would affect the foraging choice of these two types of bees. In this study nectar and pollen quality is represented by various levels of sugar and protein content, respectively, as well as the number of open strawberry flowers in the experimental field, would affect the foraging choice of these two types of bees. Consistent with previous studies, we found significant and major differences between strawberry varieties in proportions of sucrose in the nectar sugar and in pollen viability – a proxy for pollen protein content. All measured parameters had a significant effect on red mason bee visitation frequency. Contrary to expectations, honeybee foraging behavior was only affected by the number of open flowers and not by any of the quality parameters measured. Our findings indicate that red mason bees were capable of assessing nectar and pollen quality and prioritize accordingly. The pattern observed indicates that individual red mason bees changed foraging focus between strawberry varieties depending on whether nectar or pollen was collected.

In cooperatively breeding and eusocial taxa, there is potential for parents to strategically manipulate offspring phenotype in their own interests. Social insect queens are nearly always larger than their worker offspring, and queens could benefit by producing small daughter workers in several ways. If queens use aggression to dominate or coerce workers, a queen producing small workers might minimize potential conflict or competition from her offspring. In addition, because of the tradeoff between the number of workers she is able to produce and their individual size, a queen may produce small workers to optimize colony work effort. In this study, we investigate why queens of the primitively eusocial paper wasp Polistes gallicus limit the size of their workers. We created queen–worker size mismatches by cross-fostering queens between nests. We then tested whether the queen–worker size difference affects worker foraging and reproductive effort, or the amount of aggression in the group. Some of our results were consistent with the idea that queens limit worker size strategically: small workers were no less successful foragers, so that producing a larger number of smaller workers may overall increase queen fitness. We found that queens were less likely to attack large workers, perhaps because attempting to coerce large workers is riskier. However, larger workers did not forage less, did not invest more in ovarian development, and were not more aggressive themselves. There was therefore little evidence overall that queens limit conflict by producing smaller workers.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s00265-019-2646-3\", \"PMID: 30880867\", \"ISSN: 1432-0762\", \"EISSN: 1432-0762\", \"ISSN: 0340-5443\"]}\n",

However, how an organism's developmental speed is linked with elemental body composition, metabolism and behavior is not well understood. We compared elemental body composition, latency to resume activity and resting metabolic rate (RMR) of western stutter-trilling crickets (\\n) in three selection lines that differ in developmental speed. We found that slowly developing crickets had significantly higher body carbon, lower body nitrogen and higher carbon-to-nitrogen ratio than rapidly developing crickets. Slowly developing crickets had significantly higher RMR than rapidly developing crickets. Male crickets had higher RMR than females. Slowly developing crickets resumed activity faster in an unfamiliar relative to a familiar environment. The rapidly developing crickets did the opposite. The results highlight the tight association between life history, physiology and behavior.

Growing evidence of the transmission of parasites through the shared‐use of flowers by pollinators demonstrate the importance of behavioral immunity (altered behaviors that enhance parasite resistance) to pollinator health. During foraging bouts, pollinators can protect themselves against parasites through self‐medication, disease avoidance, and grooming. Recent studies have documented immune behaviors in foraging pollinators, as well as the impacts of such behaviors on flower visitation. Because pollinator parasites can affect flower choice and pollen dispersal, they may ultimately impact flower fitness. Here, we discuss how pollinator immune behaviors and floral traits may affect the presence and transmission of pollinator parasites, as well as how pollinator parasites, through these immune behaviors, can impact plant–pollinator interactions. We further discuss how pollinator immune behaviors can impact plant fitness, and how floral traits may adapt to optimize plant fitness in response to pollinator parasites. We propose future research directions to assess the role of pollinator parasites in plant–pollinator interactions and evolution, and we propose better integration of the role of pollinator parasites into research related to pollinator optimal foraging theory, floral diversity and agricultural practices.\\nThe effects of behavioral immunity on pollinator foraging decisions and floral evolution have been largely overlooked.

The exported subspecies B. t. terrestris has colonised diverse environments, in some cases displacing wild pollinators to the verge of local extinction. In this sense, the native Iberian subspecies B. t. lusitanicus may be threatened by the subspecies B. t. terrestris, naturally distributed from the Pyrenees to Central Europe but also observed in southern Spain due to escapes from commercial nests. Mitochondrial genomes have a low recombination rate and a small effective population size owing to their maternal inheritance, thus providing an accurate approach to study hybridisation events between populations. Therefore, we present the sequences of the mitogenomes of both subspecies as a molecular framework to select suitable markers to detect possible introgression events between them. We used metagenomics to obtain approximately 17 kbp of the mitogenome from both subspecies. Their mitogenomes differed in 358 bp (excluding the AT‐rich region). Four mitogenomic fragments were selected to be tested as subspecific diagnostic markers. A RFLP detected in the gene nad2 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2) has proven to be an efficient, quick and cost‐effective tool to assess the dispersion of the non‐endemic subspecies into Iberian native populations. Subspecific haplotypes were observed in both morphological subspecies, suggesting introgression events in the northern natural contact area and in the new human‐mediated contact area in the south of the Iberian Peninsula.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1111/age.12874\", \"ISSN: 0268-9146\", \"PMID: 31648380\", \"EISSN: 1365-2052\"]}\n",

Here we assess the influence of sulfoxaflor exposure on bumblebee larval mortality and growth both when tested in insolation and when in combination with the common fungal parasite Nosema bombi, following a pre-registered design. We found no significant impact of sulfoxaflor (5 ppb) or N. bombi exposure (50 000 spores) on larval mortality when tested in isolation but found an additive, negative effect when larvae received both stressors in combination. Individually, sulfoxaflor and N. bombi exposure each impaired larval growth, although the impact of combined exposure fell significantly short of the predicted sum of the individual effects (i.e. they interacted antagonistically). Ultimately, our results suggest that colony-level consequences of sulfoxaflor exposure for bumblebees may be mediated through direct effects on larvae.

All pesticides (except imidacloprid) inhibited mitochondrial respiration fueled by pyruvate + malate; the strongest effect was observed for rotenone and difenocanozole. Three pesticides (dithianon, rotenone, and difenocanozole) affected the rate of H2O2 production. To study the pesticide-induced DNA damage in vitro and in vivo, we used three different mtDNA.

Acute oral and topical LD50 values for B. terrestris against these insecticides were broadly consistent with published results for A. mellifera. For the neonicotinoids, imidacloprid was highly toxic, but thiacloprid and acetamiprid were practically non-toxic. For pyrethroids, deltamethrin was highly toxic, but tau-fluvalinate only slightly toxic. For the organophosphates, chlorpyrifos was highly toxic, but coumaphos practically non-toxic. Bioassays using insecticides with common synergists enhanced the sensitivity of B. terrestris to several insecticides, suggesting detoxification enzymes may provide a level of protection against these compounds.\\nThe sensitivity of B. terrestris to compounds within three different insecticide classes is similar to that reported for honey bees, with marked variation in sensitivity to different insecticides within the same insecticide class observed in both species. This finding highlights the need to consider each compound within an insecticide class in isolation rather than extrapolating between different insecticides in the same class or sharing the same mode of action.\\n[Display omitted]\\n•Acute toxicity of popular insecticides to Bombus terrestris audax was assessed.•Compounds from 3 major classes were tested in topical and oral bioassays.•Bioassays with different synergists were done for each compound.•Results show stark differential toxicity of insecticides within the same class.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.104562\", \"EISSN: 1095-9939\", \"ISSN: 1095-9939\", \"ISSN: 0048-3575\", \"PMID: 32448417\"]}\n",

More concentrated nectar is more rewarding, but also more viscous, and hence more time-consuming to drink. Consequently, theory predicts an optimum concentration for maximizing energy uptake rate, dependent on the mechanics of feeding. For social pollinators such as bumblebees, another important but little-studied aspect of foraging is nectar offloading upon return to the nest. Studying the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, we found that the relationship between viscosity (µ) and volumetric transfer rates (Q) of sucrose solutions differed between drinking and offloading. For drinking, Q µ−0.180, in good agreement with previous work. Although offloading was quicker than drinking, offloading rate decreased faster with viscosity, with Q µ−0.502, consistent with constraints imposed by fluid flow through a tube. The difference in mechanics between drinking and offloading nectar leads to a conflict in the optimum concentration for maximizing energy transfer rates. Building a model of foraging energetics, we show that including offloading lowers the maximum rate of energy return to the nest and reduces the concentration which maximizes this rate by around 3%. Using our model, we show that published values of preferred nectar sugar concentrations suggest that bumblebees maximize the overall energy return rather than the instantaneous energy uptake during drinking.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 31964267\", \"ISSN: 1742-5689\", \"DOI: 10.1098/rsif.2019.0632\", \"EISSN: 1742-5662\"]}\n",

Towards the end of the colony cycle, at the onset of the competition phase, reproductive workers will establish a dominance hierarchy and challenge the reproductive monopoly of the queen by laying unfertilized, male-destined eggs. However, it has been suggested that the dominance and reproductive hierarchies in bumblebee workers are not completely aligned. By performing manipulative experiments and observing both aggressive behaviour and ovarian activation in Bombus terrestris workers, we aimed to elucidate how these two hierarchies interact and are modulated by the presence of the queen and other reproductive workers. We found that the reintroduction of a queen in a queenless colony not only caused worker ovary regression, but also decreased aggressive interactions between workers, thereby restoring the harmony in the colony. Furthermore, transplanting dominant reproductive workers from queenless colonies into queenright colonies induced the resident workers to activate their ovaries and aggressively compete over reproduction, thereby implying that positive feedback drives the onset of the competition phase. However, we did not see this result when subordinate reproductive workers from queenless colonies were added to queenright colonies, suggesting that ovary activation is mainly initiated in reaction to displays of dominance. Additionally, we observed that workers were attacked irrespective of their reproductive state, questioning the importance of signals that advertise either fertility or sterility in bumblebees. Finally, larger workers were significantly more aggressive and significantly more likely to be attacked, even though smaller workers were equally likely to have activated ovaries. This suggests that large workers resort to aggression to increase their chances of successfully reproducing due to their inherent fighting advantage, whereas small cheater workers could possibly reproduce by staying under the radar to evade nestmate aggression.\\n•Dominance and reproductive hierarchies are not completely aligned in bumblebees.•Reintroduction of a queen causes worker ovary regression and restores harmony.•Worker competition is initiated by dominance displays of reproductive sisters.•Workers are aggressed based on their size rather than their reproductive state.•Subordinate, small reproductive workers avoid nestmate aggression.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1095-8282\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.anbehav.2020.05.007\", \"ISSN: 0003-3472\"]}\n",

Consequently, their health is of high importance for food security worldwide. Yet, recent population estimates show that their numbers are declining. This decline has been attributed to habitat loss, infection and use of pesticides. An important factor for bee health that contributes to population survival is the gut microbiome composition. The bee gut microbiome provides protection from pathogens, is specific to the host and helps break down food. Without a balanced gut microbiome, the health of the bee is threatened through increased infection and mortality. The bee gut microbiome is relatively simple, being dominated by 8 core bacterial species providing a convenient study system. Previous published data shows that air pollution has an impact on bacterial behaviour. Therefore, our hypothesis is exposure to air pollution causes an imbalance in the bee gut microbiome. To test this, we exposed bees to black carbon (BC), a major component of air pollution particulate matter. We assessed the effects on bee behaviour, microbiome composition and gut bacteria treated in vitro. Bees treated with BC showed a significant increase in viable bacterial cells in their faecal community. Independent culture of gut commensals showed that BC significantly alters the structure of their biofilms, which are important for colonisation in vivo. This supports the hypothesis that air pollution can cause an imbalance in the bee gut microbiome, and may adversely influence bee health and pollinator populations.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 2516-8290\", \"DOI: 10.1099/acmi.ac2020.po0626\", \"ISSN: 2516-8290\"]}\n",

Trajectories analysed from this tracking show the speed-curvature power law holds robustly at the population level, displaying an exponent close to two-thirds. This exponent corroborates previous findings in human movement patterns, but differs from the three-quarter exponent reported for Drosophila larval locomotion. There are conflicting hypotheses for the principal origin of these speed-curvature laws, ranging from the role of central planning to kinematic and muscular skeletal constraints. Our findings substantiate the latter idea that dynamic power-law effects are robust, differing only through kinematic constraints due to locomotive method. Our research supports the notion that these laws are present in a greater range of species than previously thought, even in the bumblebee. Such power laws may provide optimal behavioural templates for organisms, delivering a potential analytical tool to study deviations from this template.

This is likely due to the increased osmotic stress C. bombi experiences in high sugar, aqueous environments.\\n3.

We used the allatoxin Precocene-I (P-I) to reduce hemolymph JH titers and replacement therapy with the natural JH to revert this effect. In small orphan groups of workers with similar body size but mixed treatment, P-I treated bees showed lower aggressiveness, oogenesis, and dominance rank compared with control and replacement therapy treated bees. In similar groups in which all bees were treated similarly, there was a clear dominance hierarchy, even in P-I and replacement therapy treatment groups in which the bees showed similar levels of ovarian activation. In a similar experiment in which bees differed in body size, larger bees were more likely to be dominant despite their similar JH treatment and ovarian state. In the last experiment, we show that JH manipulation does not affect dominance rank in groups that had already established a stable dominance hierarchy.

Micro-computed tomography scanning and segmentation of multiple brain neuropils showed exposure during either of the developmental stages caused reduced mushroom body calycal growth relative to unexposed workers. Associated with this was a lower probability of responding to a sucrose reward and lower learning performance in an olfactory conditioning test. While calycal volume of control workers positively correlated with learning score, this relationship was absent for exposed workers indicating neuropil functional impairment. Comparison of 3- and 12-day adults exposed during brood development showed a similar degree of reduced calycal volume and impaired behaviour highlighting lasting and irrecoverable effects from exposure despite no adult exposure.

Moreover, predation vulnerability often varies among pollinators' body sizes with interspecific comparisons showing that smaller species are more vulnerable than larger ones. However, how intraspecific body size variation influences pollinator behaviour under predation risk is still unknown, especially under natural conditions.\\nWe hypothesized that bumblebee workers of different sizes will exhibit different foraging strategies under predation risk. We predict that (a) small workers should more often exhibit anti‐predator behaviours than larger workers. We also hypothesized that the anti‐predator behaviour should be influenced by predator size and reward availability; therefore, we expect (b) higher avoidance behaviour towards larger predator sizes and (c) more and longer visits to inflorescences with high nectar availability. Finally, we expect that (d) nectar availability should overcome the anti‐predator behaviour in less vulnerable, large, workers.\\nWe recorded flower visitation, time spent and rejection behaviours of different sizes of Bombus terrestris (Apidae) workers (large, medium and small) to inflorescences of Alstroemeria aurea (Alstroemeriaceae) with different treatments of artificial spiders (small and large) and nectar availability (with, without).\\nAnti‐predator and foraging behaviour of bumblebees was affected by the size of the worker, the presence of artificial spiders and nectar availability. Large and medium size bumblebees strongly reduced flower visitation and time spent in the presence of artificial spiders, consistently avoiding flowers with spiders, regardless of spider size or nectar availability. Instead, small bumblebees seldom modified their behaviour when facing artificial spiders, only increasing their avoidance or decreasing their foraging time in nectarless flowers hosting large artificial spiders.\\nThis pattern of larger workers being more sensitive to predation risk than smaller ones at the intraspecific level in B. terrestris is contrary to the expected and acknowledged trend based on previous interspecific comparisons, but partially consistent with predictions of models of optimal foraging theory. Intraspecific behavioural variability was uncovered only when nectar was available, whereas artificial predator size rarely modified bumblebee anti‐predator and foraging behaviour. Therefore, our findings suggest that the trade‐off between maximizing resource intake and minimizing predation risk strongly varies across bumblebee worker body sizes.\\nTranslated\\nResumen\\nLos depredadores que cazan sobre flores hacen que éstas sean sitios peligrosos de forrajeo para los polinizadores, pudiendo afectar su comportamiento.

These foraging patterns play an important role in both crop production and wild plant fitness. However, in classical observational studies, pollinator spillover patterns may be confounded by differences in pollinator phenologies and population sizes. To avoid these confounding effects, we quantified the combined effect of relative floral availability and season on pollinator spillover between strawberry crops and adjacent pinewoods by using commercial bumblebee colonies. We used 60 colonies that were placed in 6 open polytunnel strawberry crops and in 8 pinewoods adjacent to crops in landscapes with either low or high berry (mostly strawberry) crop cover. We repeated the experiment in winter and in spring to account for differences in flower resource availability. While strawberries were in bloom during the entire study period, wild flowering plants were scarce and abundant in winter and in spring, respectively. Spillover in crops was quantified as the percentage of bumblebee individuals that carried pollen from non-berry flowers, while spillover in pinewoods was quantified as the percentage of individuals that carried pollen from berry flowers. Overall, 526 bumblebees were collected. We found them carrying the pollen of 15 plant taxa in winter and 39 in spring, in accordance with seasonal floral availability. In crop colonies, around 30% of bumblebees spilled over into non-berry habitats in winter and 78% in spring, regardless of crop cover in the surrounding landscape. However, in pinewood colonies, we found an interaction effect between season and crop cover: even though on average 34% of bumblebees spilled over into berry crops, in winter it was almost twice in landscapes with high crop cover. Spillover patterns mainly mirrored seasonal changes in floral availability between habitats.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1007/s13592-020-00782-1\", \"ISSN: 1297-9678\", \"ISSN: 0044-8435\", \"EISSN: 1297-9678\"]}\n",

Here we showed that free-flying bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, learned chromatic, achromatic and visual-olfactory bimodal negative patterning discrimination. Further analyses showed that individual bumble bees adopted distinct strategies in approaching negative patterning discrimination, some solving the task in a configural manner, while others solved it via a simpler strategy.

Abundance and diversity in flower availability benefit bee populations; however, little is known about which of protein or carbohydrate resources may limit their growth and reproductive performance. Here, we test the hypothesis of complementary resource limitation using a supplemental feeding approach. We applied this assumption with bumble bees (Bombus terrestris), assuming that colony growth and reproductive performance should depend on the continuous supply of carbohydrates and proteins, through the foraging for nectar and pollen, respectively. We placed wild-caught bumble bee colonies along a landscape gradient of seminatural habitats, and monitored the colonies’ weight, foraging activity, and reproductive performance during the whole colony cycle. We performed supplemental feeding as an indicator of landscape resource limitation, using a factorial design consisting of the addition of sugar water (carbohydrate, supplemented or not) crossed by pollen (protein, supplemented or not). Bumble bee colony dynamics showed a clear seasonal pattern with a period of growth followed by a period of stagnation. Higher abundance of seminatural habitats resulted in reducing the proportion of pollen foragers relative to all foragers in both periods, and in improving the reproductive performance of bumble bees. Interestingly, the supplemental feeding of sugar water positively affected the colony weight during the stagnation period, and the supplemental feeding of pollen mitigated the landscape effect on pollen collection investment. Single and combined supplementation of sugar water and pollen increased the positive effect of seminatural habitats on reproductive performance. This study reveals a potential colimitation in pollen and nectar resources affecting foraging behavior and reproductive performance in bumble bees, and indicates that even in mixed agricultural landscapes with higher proportions of seminatural habitats, bumble bee populations face resource limitations. We conclude that the seasonal management of floral resources must be considered in conservation to support bumble bee populations and pollination services in farmlands.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1939-9170\", \"ISSN: 0012-9658\", \"DOI: 10.1002/ecy.2946\", \"ISSN: 1939-9170\", \"PMID: 31840224\"]}\n",

In a previous proof‐of‐concept study, the CAP2b analogues 1895 (2Abf‐Suc‐FGPRLamide) and 2129 (2Abf‐Suc‐ATPRIamide) were reported to reduce aphid fitness when administered by injection. In the current study, the insecticidal efficacy of 1895 and 2129 on the peach potato aphid Myzus persicae was analyzed by topical application, simulating a spray application scenario in the field. Additionally, the selectivity of the tested analogues was evaluated against a selection of beneficial insects, namely three natural enemies (Adalia bipunctata, Chrysoperla carnea and Nasonia vitripennis) and a pollinator (Bombus terrestris).\\nRESULTS\\nWithin 3–5 days post topical exposure of aphids to 1895, higher mortality (33%) was observed, as was the case for the treatment with 2129 (17%) and the mixture of 1895 + 2129 (47%) compared to the control (3%). 1895 and the mix 1895 + 2129 showed the strongest and comparable insecticidal effects. Additionally, surviving aphids treated with 1895 showed a reduction in total lifetime reproduction (GRR) of 30%, 19% with 2129 and 39% with the mix 1895 + 2129. Of interest from a biosafety perspective is that by using the same delivery method and dose, no significant effects on survival, weight increase and food intake was observed for the representative natural enemies and the pollinator.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThis study highlights the potential of exploiting CAP2b analogues such as 1895 (core structure FGPRL) as aphicides. Additionally, the CAP2b analogues used in this study were selective as they showed no effects when applied on four representative beneficial insects.\\nUsing topical exposure, this study demonstrated CAPA‐PK analogues were effective in expediting aphid mortality and reducing reproduction, while remaining selective and non‐toxic to four representative beneficial insects.\\n© 2020 Society of Chemical Industry\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1002/ps.5971\", \"EISSN: 1526-4998\", \"ISSN: 1526-498X\", \"ISSN: 1526-4998\"]}\n",

We show that bumblebees, Bombus terrestris, overcome this challenge by relying on lipids as nutritional cue when selecting pollen.

Here, we used Bombus impatiens to explore two elements of these reported preferences, with the aim of understanding their ecological implication and underlying mechanism. First, we asked whether preferences persisted across a range of realistic nectar sugar concentrations, when measured at a series of time points up until 24 h. Second, we tested whether bees' neonicotinoid preferences were driven by an ability to associate their post-ingestive consequences with floral stimuli such as colour, location or scent. We found no evidence that foragers preferred to consume neonicotinoid-containing solutions, despite finding effects on feeding motivation and locomotor activity in line with previous work. Bees also did not preferentially visit floral stimuli previously paired with a neonicotinoid-containing solution. These results highlight the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying bees’ responses to these pesticides, critical for determining how neonicotinoid-driven foraging preferences might operate in the real world for different bee species.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 2054-5703\", \"EISSN: 2054-5703\", \"DOI: 10.1098/rsos.191883\", \"PMID: 32537195\"]}\n",

What little is known about the environmental factors determining their distributions stems from studies in Central and Western Europe, but even less information is available about their distributions in Eastern Europe, where different subspecies occur.

First, we genetically identified sampled individuals from many sites across the study area. We then not only computed species distributions based on presence‐only data, but also expanded on these models using relative abundance data. We found that B. terrestris is a more generalist species than previously thought, but that B. lucorum is restricted to forested areas with colder and wetter climates, which in our study area are primarily found at higher elevations. Both vegetation parameters such as annual mean Leaf Area Index and canopy height, as well as climatic conditions, were important in explaining their distributions.

Whereas social information from conspecifics has long been assumed to be preferentially attended by animals, heterospecifics can also provide relevant information. Because different species may vary in their informative value, using heterospecific social information indiscriminately can be ineffective and even detrimental. Here, we evaluated how selective use of social information might arise at a proximate level in bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) as a result of experience with demonstrators differing in their visual appearance and in their informative value as reward predictors. Bumblebees were first trained to discriminate rewarding from unrewarding flowers based on which type of “heterospecific” (one of two differently painted model bees) was next to each flower. Subsequently, these bumblebees were exposed to a novel foraging context with two live painted bees. In this novel context, observer bumblebees showed significantly more social information-seeking behavior towards the type of bees that had predicted reward during training. Bumblebees were not attracted by paint-marked small wooden balls (moved via magnets) or paint-marked non-pollinating heterospecifics (woodlice; Porcellio laevis) in the novel context, indicating that bees did not simply respond to conditioned color cues nor to irrelevant social cues, but rather had a “search image” of what previously constituted a valuable, versus invaluable, information provider. The behavior of our bumblebees suggests that their use of social information is governed by learning, is selective, and extends beyond conspecifics.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 2075-4450\", \"PMID: 33202846\", \"DOI: 10.3390/insects11110800\", \"EISSN: 2075-4450\"]}\n",

Based on a factorial design, we selected a series of spatially replicated study sites across a dual gradient of habitat amount (area of ground-vegetated vineyards) and fragmentation (density of ground-vegetated vineyard fields) in a landscape predominantly consisting of vineyards with bare grounds. The foraging activity of individual bumblebees was measured using the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, and we assessed final colony size to measure reproductive performance. We found an interactive effect of habitat amount and fragmentation on colony size. More specifically, the degree of fragmentation had a negative effect on bumblebee colony size when the amount of habitat was low, while it had a weak positive effect on colony size in landscapes with high amounts of habitat. At the level of individual vineyard fields, ground vegetation cover exerted a positive effect on bumblebee colony size. Fragmentation, but not habitat amount, significantly influenced foraging activity, with more foraging trips in sites with lower degrees of fragmentation.

In mammals, DNA methylation is often associated with genes which show allele-specific expression. DNA methylation systems have been described in species of Hymenoptera, providing a candidate mechanism. Using previously generated RNA-Seq and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing from reproductive and sterile bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) workers, we have identified genome-wide allele-specific expression and allele-specific DNA methylation. The majority of genes displaying allele-specific expression are common between reproductive and sterile workers and the proportion of allele-specific expression bias generally varies between genetically distinct colonies. We have also identified genome-wide allele-specific DNA methylation patterns in both reproductive and sterile workers, with reproductive workers showing significantly more genes with allele-specific methylation.

One important aspect of assessing and managing the risks posed by neonicotinoids to bees is the chronic effects induced by exposures at the sub-lethal levels.

In this study, we examine the interface between the serpentine endemic Ni-hyperaccumulator Odontarrhena lesbiaca and its consumers of different plant parts: leaves (consumers), floral parts (consumers and primitive pollinators), and floral rewards (true pollinators). The study was conducted at two serpentine areas on Lesvos, Greece. Over 13 rounds of sampling during the flowering period of O. lesbiaca in both areas we collected plant stems with flowers, consumers of different plant parts, and flower visitors. Collected animals were mainly insects and some spiders. Chemical analyses showed negligible Ni-concentration differences between the two areas. Among all plant parts, the lowest Ni concentration was found in pollen and the highest in leaves. Regarding animal dietary habits, folivores accumulated the highest Ni concentrations, therefore characterized as “high-Ni insects”, while floral-reward consumers, both primary (bees) and secondary (Eristalis tenax, Pygopleurus spp., and wasps), bore low Ni loads. Ni-body load of predators that fed on animals that were passing by was also low. Among floral-reward consumers, short-range fliers (bees of the genera Andrena and Lasioglossum) accumulated higher Ni loads than long-range fliers (Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris, Eristalis tenax). Solitary Andrena bees accumulated higher Ni concentration than eusocial honeybees (Apis mellifera) and bumblebees (Bombus terrestris); a group of Lasioglossum specimens encompassing both solitary and eusocial bees lay in between.

These scenarios differ in terms of whether the signaling system was built on preadaptations on the part of either the sender queens or the receiver workers. While some social insect QPs—such as cuticular hydrocarbons—were likely derived from ancestral fertility cues and evolved according to the former theory, the honeybee’s queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) has been suggested to act directly on preexisting gene-regulatory networks linked with reproduction. This is evidenced by the fact that QMP has been shown to also inhibit ovary activation in fruit flies, thereby implying exploitation of conserved physiological pathways. To verify whether QMP has similar effects on more closely related eusocial species, we here tested for QMP cross-activity in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. Interestingly, we found that the non-native QMP blend significantly inhibited egg laying in both worker and queen bumblebees and caused accompanying shifts in ovary activation. The native bumblebee QP pentacosane, by contrast, only inhibited the reproduction of the workers. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that honeybee QMP likely evolved via a route of sensory exploitation. We argue that such exploitation could allow social insect queens to produce compounds that manipulate the workers to remain sterile, but that a major hurdle would be that the queens themselves would have to be immune to such compounds.\\nBumblebees are forced to bend the knee to honeybee queen pheromones. We show that the honeybee-specific queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) that stops honeybee workers from reproducing, also inhibits reproduction in bumblebee workers and queens, thus exploiting physiological pathways that are highly conserved in insects.

The use of entomophilous pollination, commonly adopted for other crops, may be of key importance in order to improve seed yields in seed‐propagated globe artichoke (Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus) cultivars. In this regard, in a 2‐year field experiment, the role of two honeybees (Apis mellifera ligustica and A. mellifera siciliana) and one bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) was evaluated on the seed production of two globe artichoke cultivars in caged‐protected environments. Overall, the number and weight of seeds plant−1 and head−1, 1,000 seed weight and fruit setting were higher in caged plants with imposed pollination than open field plants. The pollination efficiency was both insect and cultivar dependent. Both honeybee species performed better on the Mediterranean cultivar ‘Violetto di Sicilia’, while the bumblebee performed better on the Brazilian cultivar ‘NP4’. These results could be very useful to modernise the agronomic management of globe artichoke and reduce the costs of cultivation. In addition, such knowledge can be used to improve the seed production in globe artichoke seed‐propagated cultivars and cardoon. This will benefit the bioenergy, nutraceutical, cosmetic and ornamental applications.\\nGlobe artichoke seed‐propagated cultivars are gaining in popularity. In this study, entomophilous pollination operated by honeybees and bumblebees was demonstrated to play a key role on globe artichoke seed production in terms of number and weight of seeds plant−1 and head−1, 1000 seed weight and fruit setting, with insect‐ and cultivar‐dependent results.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1111/aab.12570\", \"EISSN: 1744-7348\", \"ISSN: 0003-4746\"]}\n",

The drivers of this decline have been well documented in Europe and involve multiple factors such as pesticides, pathogens, poor nutrition, climate change, and their respective interactions. For pesticides, there is a lack of information concerning the impacts of exposure when the bees have access to pollen diet of different nutritional quality (e.g. variation in sterol and protein content). We performed bioassays on nine groups consisting of 10 Bombus terrestris microcolonies (i.e. queen less colonies) each in a fully crossed experiment including controls without pesticide, two different doses of neonicotinoid imidacloprid (2 and 20 μg/L) and three pollen diets (i.e. Salix mix, cellulose-diluted Salix mix and cellulose-diluted Salix mix enriched with soy protein). All colonies were fed ad libitum with syrup and pollen. We measured the collection of pollen and syrup, the brood mass and the pollen efficacy (ratio of brood mass/pollen) at the end of the experiment. All these variables were affected by the imidacloprid doses, especially pollen efficacy, which was two and 10 times lower than the control for the 2 and 20 μg/L treatments, respectively. As expected, pollen efficacy was also affected by the pollen diet. However, when exposed to imidacloprid, the three different pollen diets did not affect micro-colonies performances. Overall, we show that diet quality does not affect sensitivity to imidacloprid exposure. It seems therefore that the negative effects of imidacloprid exposure cannot be compensated for by a pollen diet of high quality.\\n•Bumblebee micro-colonies were exposed to imidacloprid and fed on three pollen diets.•Both diet quality and imidacloprid exposure affected micro-colony performances.•When exposed to pesticide, diet quality does no longer affect brood development.•Rich-nutrient diet did not reduce the negative effects of pesticide exposure.•Mitigation strategies should include measures to prevent agrochemical use.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1016/j.actao.2020.103552\", \"EISSN: 1873-6238\", \"ISSN: 1146-609X\"]}\n",

In this study, we compared the properties of vibrations produced by\\n(Hymenoptera: Apidae) workers in three contexts: during flight, during defensive buzzing, and in floral vibrations produced during pollen foraging on two buzz-pollinated plants (\\n, Solanaceae). Using laser vibrometry, we were able to obtain contactless measures of both the frequency and amplitude of the thoracic vibrations of bees across the three behaviours. Despite all three types of vibrations being produced by the same power flight muscles, we found clear differences in the mechanical properties of the vibrations produced in different contexts. Both floral and defensive buzzes had higher frequency and amplitude velocity, acceleration and displacement than the vibrations produced during flight. Floral vibrations had the highest frequency, amplitude velocity and acceleration of all the behaviours studied. Vibration amplitude, and in particular acceleration, of floral vibrations has been suggested as the key property for removing pollen from buzz-pollinated anthers.

To determine whether environmental stressors interact to affect pollination services, we carried out field cage experiments on the buff-tailed bumble bee (\\n). Using a Bayesian approach, we assessed whether heat stress (colonies maintained at an ambient temperature of 25 °C or 31 °C) and insecticide exposure (5 ng g\\nof the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin) could induce behavioural changes that affected pollination of faba bean (\\n). Only the bumble bee colonies and not the plants were exposed to the environmental stress treatments. Bean plants exposed to heat-stressed bumble bee colonies (31 °C) had a lower proportional pod set compared to colonies maintained at 25 °C. There was also weak evidence that heat stressed colonies caused lower total bean weight. Bee exposure to clothianidin was found to have no clear effect on plant yields, either individually or as part of an interaction. We identified no effect of either colony stressor on bumble bee foraging behaviours. Our results suggest that extreme heat stress at the colony level may impact on pollination services.

Due to the metabolic activities of yeasts, sugar and amino acid composition of nectar often drastically change and may negatively impact the nutritional value of nectar for pollinators and hence insect fitness. On the other hand, the presence of yeasts in floral nectar may also increase its nutritional value due to yeast's probiotic effect and the release of yeast's metabolites. In this study, we investigated whether the presence of defined flower‐ and insect‐associated yeasts affected individual and colony fitness of the bumble bee pollinatorBombus terrestris. Specifically, we tested whether the presence of yeasts in nectar affected bumble bee foraging behavior and nectar consumption, individual growth and colony development, larval and queen mortality, and mating success. Quantitative analyses of sugar and amino acid profiles showed that nectar yeasts significantly affected the chemical composition of nectar. However, dual‐choice experiments indicated that yeast inoculation did not significantly affect foraging behavior or consumption rates. Nest development, on the other hand, was significantly affected by the presence of yeasts, but effects largely depended on species identity, withCandida bombiphila,Metschnikowia gruessii, andRhodotorula mucilaginosahaving the largest positive impact on colony growth. Interestingly, the effects at the colony level were more pronounced than at the individual level. In vitro growth tests further showed that yeasts have the potential to suppress the growth of the bumble bee gut pathogenCrithidia bombi. Overall, these results demonstrate that nectar‐inhabiting yeasts can have diverse effects on bumble bee fitness and therefore may mediate plant–pollinator mutualisms.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 0012-9615\", \"ISSN: 1557-7015\", \"EISSN: 1557-7015\", \"DOI: 10.1002/ecm.1393\"]}\n",

Flower strips can increase the abundance and sometimes the diversity of bumble bees at local scales, but the importance of flower strips for bumble bee populations at larger scales remains poorly understood. We investigated the effect of flower strips on bumble bee colony growth and reproduction at landscape scales. Commercial bumble bee colonies of a native species (Bombus terrestris) were placed and monitored at different distances from flower strips that were sown on existing ecological focus areas (European Common Agricultural Policy) in southern Sweden. Both the average colony growth (weight) and the production of reproductives (drones and queens) were highest for colonies adjacent to flower strips and declined with increasing distance. Colonies close to the flower strip also produced more reproductives per colony weight. Colony foraging activity was negatively related to the distance to flower strips whereas worker size was not affected. Annual flower strips in ecological focus areas benefit bumble bee colonies by increasing foraging success, colony growth and finally boosting sexual reproduction, demonstrating potential benefits for pollination within and between seasons. These effects were spatially limited but extended to foraging ranges of bumble bees. However, effects of increased colony growth on the abundance of foraging bees in the landscape may extend to larger distances because of forager movements within seasons and queen dispersal between seasons, suggesting that voluntary or incentivised collaboration between farmers may be needed to achieve optimal implementation of flower strips.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108814\", \"ISSN: 1873-2917\", \"EISSN: 1873-2917\", \"ISSN: 0006-3207\"]}\n",

A sustained exposure to even trace residues could be severely harmful if the ingested substance has a long biological half‐life and its toxicity therefore intensifies over time, which is termed time‐reinforced toxicity (TRT). Bumble bees are important farmland pollinators, but their susceptibility to TRT from insecticides has not been established previously. This study therefore investigated the potential for three farmland insecticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and fipronil) to generate TRT in bumble bees (Bombus terrestris L.) by dietary exposure in the laboratory using lethality as an endpoint under both fixed‐dose and pulsed‐dose regimes.\\nRESULTS\\nThe insecticides varied in toxic effect. Fipronil exposures produced a dose‐dependent reduction in longevity (days of exposure survived) and strong TRT with no evidence of clearance‐based recovery. Thiamethoxam exposures also produced a dose‐dependent reduction in longevity, but with moderate TRT and evidence of some clearance‐based recovery. Imidacloprid exposures produced a hormesis with reduced longevity only at the highest doses and an absence of TRT.\\nCONCLUSION\\nOur study further confirms the potential for certain dietary insecticides at trace levels to harm farmland bees during sustained exposures because of their capacity to cause time‐reinforced toxicity. Our findings suggest that regulatory oversight of pesticides will better safeguard bee health by testing the active ingredients of farmland agrochemicals for their capacity to produce TRT in these ecologically important nontarget organisms.\\nOur study demonstrates the potential for certain dietary insecticides at trace levels to harm farmland bumble bees during sustained exposures because of their capacity to cause time‐reinforced toxicity. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry\\nOur study demonstrates the potential for certain dietary insecticides at trace levels to harm farmland bumble bees during sustained exposures because of their capacity to cause time‐reinforced toxicity.\\n© 2020 Society of Chemical Industry\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1526-4998\", \"DOI: 10.1002/ps.5838\", \"ISSN: 1526-498X\", \"PMID: 32237102\"]}\n",

We investigated how mass‐flowering oilseed rape (OSR) can influence the pollen resource use of small and large honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) and bumble bee (Bombus terrestris L.) colonies. Colonies were placed adjacent to strawberry fields along a gradient of OSR availability in the landscapes. We used ITS2 metabarcoding to identify the pollen richness based on ITS2 amplicon sequencing and microscopy for quantification of target pollen. Bumble bees collected pollen from more different plant genera than honey bees. In both species, strawberry pollen collection decreased with high OSR availability but was facilitated by increasing strawberry flower cover. Colony size had no effect. The relationship between next‐generation sequencing‐generated ITS2 amplicon reads and microscopic pollen counts was positive but pollen type‐specific. Bumble bees and, to a lesser degree, honey bees collected pollen from a wide variety of plants. Therefore, in order to support pollinators and associated pollination services, future conservation schemes should sustain and promote pollen plant richness in agricultural landscapes. Both bee species responded to the availability of flower resources in the landscape. Although honey bees collected slightly more strawberry pollen than bumble bees, both can be considered as crop pollinators. Metabarcoding could provide similar quantitative information to microscopy, taking into account the pollen types, but there remains high potential to improve the methodological weaknesses.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.1111/mec.15675\", \"ISSN: 1365-294X\", \"PMID: 33030785\", \"ISSN: 0962-1083\", \"EISSN: 1365-294X\"]}\n",

Rare species have disappeared from the city—Bombus fragrans, B. cullumanus, and B. jonellus. The core of urban bumblebee communities consists of ecologically plastic species, most of which belong to the functional morphoecological “short-tongued” group (83%). The more specialized “medium-tongued” and “long-tongued” species are less diverse. Their populations make up 14% and 3% of the total bumblebee population. Five most common species, B. lucorum, B. terrestris, B. lapidarius, B. pascuorum, and B. hypnorum, are found at locations of the most noted categories of habitats. One of the main factors affecting the diversity of morphoecological groups of bumblebees in urban conditions is the state of floral resources. The bumblebees are observed feeding on more than 60 plant species of the families Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, Rosaceae, and Salicaceae in urban environment; however, the insects favored plants of 30 species. The ornamental, ruderal, and some invasive species of plants are significant in bumblebees’ feeding in urban conditions. The resources for bumblebee feeding and sustainable density of nesting sites are rich in quality and quantity only at a few of model urban sites.

Here, we investigated honey bees', Apis mellifera, inspection and choices of unfamiliar flowers based on both natural colour preferences and simultaneous foraging information from conspecifics and heterospecifics. Individual honey bees' preferences for flowers were recorded when the reward levels of a learned flower type had declined and novel-coloured flowers were available where they would find either no social information or one conspecific and one heterospecific bumble bee, Bombus terrestris, each foraging from a different coloured flower (magenta or yellow). Honey bees showed a natural preference for magenta flowers. They modified their inspection of both types of flowers in response to conspecific and heterospecific social information. The presence of a conspecific demonstrator on the less-preferred yellow flower increased honey bees' inspection of yellow flowers and the likelihood of foraging on them, thus outweighing the original preference for magenta flowers. The presence of a heterospecific on a magenta flower increased honey bees' inspection of magenta flowers, but this effect was not observed when bumble bees fed on yellow flowers. Our results indicate that flower colour preferences of honey bees are rapidly adjusted in response to both conspecific and heterospecific presence, in different ways, with a preference for conspecific information possibly favouring the transmission of adaptive foraging information within species.\\n•Honey bees' colour preferences are influenced by conspecifics and heterospecifics•Honey bees' colour preferences are overridden by conspecific social information.•Honey bees discriminate conspecific from bumble bees when making foraging decisions.•Conspecific social information is prioritized in a foraging context.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1095-8282\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.anbehav.2020.10.008\", \"ISSN: 0003-3472\", \"ISSN: 1095-8282\"]}\n",

Bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) microcolonies experienced reduced pollen consumption, mortality, and reproduction as well as increased stress responses when exposed to nutritional and mechanical pollen defenses.

We found that longevity was highest for pure pollen and lowest for pure sucrose solution and sucrose solution supplemented with amino acids in concentrations as found in the nectar of several plant species. Adding higher concentrations of amino acids to sucrose solution did only slightly increase longevity compared to sucrose alone. Consequently, sucrose solution with the applied concentrations and proportions of amino acids or other protein sources (e.g., casein) alone did not meet the nutritional needs of healthy adult bumble bees. In fact, longevity was highest and reproduction only successful in micro-colonies fed pollen. These results indicate that, in addition to carbohydrates and protein, adult bumble bees, like larvae, need further nutrients (e.g., lipids and micro-nutrients) for their well-being.

Using the insect growth regulator diflubenzuron as a reference toxicant, we monitored microcolony development from egg laying to drone emergence using the Eastern bumble bee Bombus impatiens (C.), a non-Apis species native to North America.

We manipulated bumblebee density by using different numbers of colonies within the same area of floral resource. In high-density compartments, slow bee paralysis virus was transmitted more quickly, resulting in higher prevalence and level of infection in bumblebee hosts. By contrast, there was no impact of density on the transmission of the trypanosome Crithidia bombi, which may reflect the ease with which this parasite is transmitted. These results suggest that agri-environment schemes such as flower strips, which are known to enhance the nutrition and survival of bumblebees, may also have negative impacts on pollinators through enhanced disease transmission.

Furthermore, how combined patterns (using multiple signalling modalities) affect floral guide function has only been investigated in a few modality combinations. We assessed how artificial flowers induce behaviours in bumblebees when rewards are indicated by unimodal temperature patterns, unimodal colour patterns or multimodal combinations of these. Bees visiting flowers with unimodal temperature patterns showed an increased probability of finding rewards and increased learning of reward location, compared to bees visiting flowers without patterns. However, flowers with contrasting unimodal colour patterns showed further guide-related behavioural changes in addition to these, such as reduced reward search times and attraction to the rewarding feeder without learning. This shows that temperature patterns alone can function as a floral guide, but with reduced efficiency. When temperature patterns were added to colour patterns, bees showed similar improvements in learning reward location and reducing their number of failed visits in addition to the responses seen to colour patterns.

This has traditionally been done by netting foragers at nest entrances or on flowers, chilling the bees on ice, and then removing the pollen loads from the corbiculae with forceps or a brush. This method is time and labor intensive, may alter normal foraging behavior, and can result in stinging incidents for the worker performing the task. Pollen traps, such as those used on honey bee hives, collect pollen by dislodging corbicular pollen loads from the legs of workers as they pass through screens at the nest entrance. Traps can remove a large quantity of pollen from returning forager bees with minimal labor, yet to date no such trap is available for use with bumble bee colonies. Workers within a bumble bee colony can vary in size making size selection of entrances difficult to adapt this mechanism to commercially reared bumble bee hives. Using 3D printing design programs, we created a pollen trap that successfully removes the corbicular pollen loads from the legs of returning bumble bee foragers. This method significantly reduces the amount of time required by researchers to collect pollen from bumble bee foragers returning to the colony. We present the design, results of pollen removal efficiency tests, and suggest areas of modifications for investigators to adapt traps to a variety of bumble bee species or nest box designs.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.3791/61500\", \"ISSN: 1940-087X\", \"EISSN: 1940-087X\"]}\n",

In bees, vibrations are used in a variety of contexts including communication, as a warning signal to deter predators and during pollen foraging.

In this study, we compared the properties of vibrations produced by Bombus terrestris audax (Hymenoptera: Apidae) workers in three contexts: during flight, during defensive buzzing, and in floral vibrations produced during pollen foraging on two buzz-pollinated plants (Solanum, Solanaceae). Using laser vibrometry, we were able to obtain contactless measures of both the frequency and amplitude of the thoracic vibrations of bees across the three behaviours. Despite all three types of vibrations being produced by the same power flight muscles, we found clear differences in the mechanical properties of the vibrations produced in different contexts. Both floral and defensive buzzes had higher frequency and amplitude velocity, acceleration, and displacement than the vibrations produced during flight. Floral vibrations had the highest frequency, amplitude velocity and acceleration of all the behaviours studied. Vibration amplitude, and in particular acceleration, of floral vibrations has been suggested as the key property for removing pollen from buzz-pollinated anthers. By increasing frequency and amplitude velocity and acceleration of their vibrations during vibratory pollen collection, foraging bees may be able to maximise pollen removal from flowers, although their foraging decisions are likely to be influenced by the presumably high cost of producing floral vibrations.\", \"identifier\": [\"PMID: 34005588\", \"EISSN: 1477-9145\"]}\n",

Complex landscape‐experiments are required to fill this knowledge gap, enabling the implementation of sustainable intensification of food production.\\nIn our study, we compared the effectiveness of the two most popular AES in Germany, organic farming and flower strips, in supporting pollinators and flower resources. We selected nine landscapes along a gradient of increasing field size, (configurational heterogeneity), each with a triplet of winter wheat fields: one organic, one conventional with flower strip and one conventional without flower strip as a control. We surveyed insect‐pollinated plants and pollinators (bumblebees, solitary bees and hoverflies). Additionally, we placed bumblebee colonies in the field edges to monitor their growth (colony weight gain) and reproduction (queen production).\\nFlower strips stood out with the highest abundance and richness of pollinators. In contrast, bumblebee colony growth and plant richness benefited equally from organic and flower strip schemes. At the landscape scale, smaller fields had a positive effect on plant richness and bumblebee reproduction in flower strips. By contrast, bumblebee colonies in organic agriculture benefited most from large fields, as large organic fields provided much more flower resources than the narrow flower strips.\\nSynthesis and applications. Our results showed that both local and landscape management shaped pollinator communities and their reproduction.

Dose rates comparable to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (50–400 µGy h−1) impaired bumblebee reproduction and delayed colony growth but did not affect colony weight or longevity. Our best-fitting model for the effect of radiation dose rate on colony queen production had a strongly nonlinear concave relationship: exposure to only 100 µGy h−1 impaired reproduction by 30–45%, while further dose rate increases caused more modest additional reproductive impairment. Our data indicate that the practice of estimating effects of environmentally relevant low-dose rate exposure by extrapolating from high-dose rates may have considerably underestimated the effects of radiation.

Here we compared the antimicrobial activity of venom and hemolymph in fourteen different bumblebee species according to their life-history strategies and characteristics, i.e., overwintered queens, workers and young queens and cuckoo queens. We found no direct relation between antimicrobial activity of hemolymph and venom. Across all species, hemolymph mainly showed lysozyme-like activity (LLA) whereas venom mainly showed antimicrobial peptide (AMP) activity. While LLA activity in the hemolymph was similar among species and life-history strategies and characteristics, both factors significantly differed in venom AMP activity. Independent of body size or fat body content, young queens showed the highest venom AMP activity, followed by workers, overwintered queens, and cuckoo queens. Venom as a potential external immune trait seems not directly linked to internal immunity in bumblebees. However, the investment in external defense depends on the species and the life-history strategies and characteristics of an individual, such as social status or condition.\", \"identifier\": [\"DOI: 10.3389/fevo.2020.00062\", \"ISSN: 2296-701X\", \"EISSN: 2296-701X\"]}\n",

We designed an experiment to decouple the effects of total food abundance and its temporal availability on bumble bee microcolony development by exposing them to either constant or pulsed food availability at a high and low ration level. Microcolonies provided constant, high-rations of food grew the most, while those fed variable, but high rations gained less mass over the course of the experiment. Regardless of the temporal presentation of food, microcolonies fed low rations gained little mass over the experiment. Reproductive output was greatest in microcolonies fed high rations, regardless of the temporal availability of food, while those given low rations produced on average 27% fewer drones.

Two bumble bee species were common during the major flowering period.

The degree of floral use overlap between two bumble bee species tended to decrease when the foraging density of the longer-tongued species was high.

Although the response of bees to red colour has been investigated in lab experiments, most stimuli have been pure red, while the subtle diversity of red as perceived by humans (human-red) has received very limited attention. Here we test the hypothesis that ultraviolet (UV) reflected from human-red flowers enhances their attractiveness to bees, through increased chromatic contrast.\\nMethods\\nUsing Onosma confertum (Boraginaceae), a plant with UV-reflecting red flowers that are pollinated by bumblebees, we investigated the effects of UV reflection on pollinator responses by conducting phenotypic manipulation experiments in the field. Colour preferences of flower-naïve bumblebees were also examined. Colour perception by bumblebees was estimated in terms of chromatic and achromatic contrast, based on two different colour perception models.\\nImportant Findings\\nWe found that both natural and flower-naïve bumblebees strongly preferred visiting UV-reflecting targets compared with UV-absorbing ones. Colour models show that the UV-reflecting flowers exhibit higher spectral purity and higher chromatic contrast against the foliage background, whereas they have similar achromatic contrast in terms of green receptor contrast. These results indicate that the component of UV reflection increases chromatic contrast in O. confertum, enhancing the visual attractiveness of these red flowers to bumblebees. We further infer that the secondary reflectance might be a necessary component in human-red flowers that are primarily pollinated by animals without red receptors, such as bees.\", \"identifier\": [\"ISSN: 1752-9921\", \"EISSN: 1752-993X\", \"DOI: 10.1093/jpe/rtaa023\", \"ISSN: 1752-993X\"]}\n",

We measured 59 spectral signatures from flowers present at two preserved native habitats in South Eastern Australia and tested whether there were any significant differences in the frequency of flowers presenting higher nectar rewards depending upon the colour category of the flower signals, as perceived by bees. We also tested if there was a significant correlation between chromatic contrast and the frequency of flowers presenting higher nectar rewards. For the entire sample, and for subsets excluding species in the Asteraceae and Orchidaceae, we found no significant difference among colour categories in the frequency of high nectar reward.

We measured the color reflectance and calculated the photoreceptor excitation, spectral purity, hue, and the chromatic contrast of the floral structures in the hexagon color model.

These components often vary in several traits. Such variation may improve system performance by increasing its efficiency or its robustness to environmental change. These two outcomes, efficiency and robustness, are often thought to be in opposition. Therefore, variation may be beneficial only under certain environmental conditions. Here we aim to understand why variation evolved in a particular system, bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) colonies. Workers in these colonies vary in body size, which affects the tasks they perform as well as their starvation resistance, suggesting potential impacts on efficiency and robustness, respectively. We examine how this variation affects colony performance under different environmental conditions and how colonies respond physiologically to these conditions. We maintained colonies of equal biomass but with either variable or less variable worker body sizes using targeted worker removal. We found that colonies with variable body sizes did not produce more brood (i.e. did not show evidence of increased performance) under predictable or unpredictable food environments. However, workers that developed under the unpredictable environment were smaller relative to their weight at eclosion. This effect was due in part to an increase in stored lipids, particularly in smaller workers. These physiological changes may explain why mortality rates did not differ between the predictable and unpredictable environment. Therefore, our finding that size variation did not affect colony performance suggests that size variation may be a neutral trait, present because selection is not acting against it. Our results also suggest that workers respond physiologically to differences in environmental conditions, which is important to consider when testing system robustness.\\n•The function of assumed adaptive size variation in bumble bees is unclear.•We created colonies with different size variation in stable and unstable conditions.•Variation did not affect colony performance; conditions affected worker physiology.•Lipid storage increased under unstable conditions, particularly in smaller workers.•Variation may be a neutral trait of a system not under positive selection.\", \"identifier\": [\"EISSN: 1095-8282\", \"ISSN: 0003-3472\", \"DOI: 10.1016/j.anbehav.2020.10.018\", \"ISSN: 1095-8282\"]}\n",
